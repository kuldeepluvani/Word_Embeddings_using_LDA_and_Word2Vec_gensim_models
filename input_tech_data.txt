By Polytech Component Pte Ltd Oct The term automotive is a word that is defined as self propelled or relating with self propelled vehicles It is derived from the combination of two words of two languages Greek and Latin The first Greek word autos represents self while the second Latin word motives represents of motion Together they form a single word automotive The automotive industry started in the year s with the United States leading the entire world in the manufacturing of automobiles This was changed in the year of where Japan takes over the United States until the year of However Japan once again overtook the United States in the year until in the year of where China claims the lead by manufacturing million automobiles China Japan and the United States are currently holding on to the top three spots of the most vehicles producing countries around the whole world With a global production of nearly million automobiles in the year the automotive industry represents a very big market to venture into Polytech recognizes this huge market potential of the automotive industry and provides a wide variety of accessories that caters to the automotive industry One such accessory is the automotive keypad which can be found in the interior of any automobile Polytech is able to customize any kind of automotive keypad that is of high quality and at an economical price Besides the automotive keypad Polytech also manufactures industrial keypads and consumable keypads All these keypads enable Polytech to be the expert in producing keypads that can be used in any types of applications Finding a good automotive keypad supplier is important as the interior of an automobile will determine the overall feel Having a posh exterior but a lousy interior will destroy the brand consequently Polytech is one good supplier that is able to provide high quality automotive keypad that will greatly enhance the interior of the automobile and makes it feel luxuries An inferior automotive keypad will generally cause the consumer to feel that the entire automobile looks cheap and undesirable As the keypad communicates the driver with the functions of the car it is required to be percent functional at all times such that it works as intended when each key on the keypad is pressed and the correct feature is activated At the same time the keypad needs to be ergonomic with a great design look that attracts the driver to use it with both ease and safety There are some manufacturers who sacrifice quality in order to produce the cheapest automotive keypads that are possible to supply their customers This is usually done with interior raw materials and poorly skilled workers that are much cheaper compared with what Polytech purchases and employs The end result is a tarnished reputation of an inferior automotive interior feel It is wiser to choose Polytech as an automotive keypad supplier which has both the expertise and capacities to produce any quantity and quantity of keypads required for any kinds of automotive interiors About the Author In Order To Find Out More On Details Touch Panel Manufacturers Kindly Checkout Our Site Today Rating

 Oct Window to the brain research to ramp up Scientists from UC Riverside and Mexican universities receive nearly million to further study method that could make it easier to treat brain conditions University of California Riverside IMAGE Illustration showing how window to the brain implant would work view more Credit UC Riverside ucr edu A team of scientists from the University of California Riverside and three Mexican universities have received about million in funding to support research to continue development of a novel transparent skull implant that literally provides a window to the brain Two years ago the UC Riverside scientists announced they had created the skull implant which is made out of the same ceramic material used for hip implants and dental crowns However the material yttria stabilized zirconia is processed in a unique way that makes it transparent When combined with the excellent biocompatibility and robustness of the zirconia this may eventually provide opportunity for laser based treatments of life threatening disorders such as brain cancer or traumatic brain injury without having to perform repeated craniotomies which are highly invasive surgical procedures that involve removing a portion of the skull to access the brain The new funding will allow the researchers to study new material developments that could provide further enhancement of important implant properties such as toughness shaping the implant so it conforms to the curvature of the skull how lasers react when passing through the ceramic implant and how the implants respond in animal studies The majority of the funding million comes from the National Science Foundation s Partnerships in International Research and Education PIRE program which pairs U S universities with others around the world An additional million will come from Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog a CONACYT Mexico s entity in charge of promoting scientific and technological activities The remainder of the money will come from in kind contributions from the Mexican universities The project is led by Guillermo Aguilar a professor of mechanical engineering at UC Riverside s Bourns College of Engineering who is originally from Mexico Five other UC Riverside professors are involved Javier Garay Lorenzo Mangolini Masaru Rao Huinan Liu and Devin Binder All are part of the Bourns College of Engineering with the exception of Binder who is part of the School of Medicine In addition David Halaney a junior specialist will help oversee activities related to the grant Three faculty members from Mexican universities are also involved Santiago Camacho L pez Centro de Investigaci n Cient fica y de Educaci n Superior de Ensenada CICESE Juan Hern ndez Cordero Universidad Nacional Aut noma de M xico UNAM and Rub n Ramos Garc a Instituto Nacional de Astrof sica ptica y Electr nica INAOE in Puebla The five year project known as Synthesis of Optical Materials for Bioapplications Research Education Recruitment and Outreach SOMBRERO program aligns with current education policy initiatives in the U S and Mexico These include President Obama s Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies BRAIN initiative as well as his strong in the Americas initiative to increase study in Latin America and the Caribbean Presidents Obama and Pe a Nieto s student mobility initiative the Binational Forum on Higher Education Innovation and Research and the UC Office of the President s UCMEXUS program and UC M xico Initiative all of which seek to create sustained strategic and equal partnerships among U S and Mexican institutions to address common issues and educate the next generation of scientific leaders The SOMBRERO program will allow students from UC Riverside and the Mexican universities to take part in six to month internships in the other country Laser based treatments have shown significant promise for many brain disorders However realization of this promise has been constrained by the need for performing a craniectomy to access the brain since most medical lasers are unable to penetrate the skull The transparent implants developed by the UC Riverside team seek to address this issue by eventually providing a permanently implanted view port through the skull Although the team s yttria stabilized zirconia windows were not the first transparent skull implants they are the first that could be conceivably used in humans which is a crucial distinction This is due to the inherent toughness of yttria stabilized zirconia which makes it far more resistant to shock and impact than the glass based implants previously demonstrated by others This not only enhances safety but it may also reduce patient self consciousness since the reduced vulnerability of the implant could minimize the need for conspicuous protective headgear Disclaimer AAAS and EurekAlert are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert by

A A On Monday Canadians will head to the polls in the final act of what has been the longest federal election campaign in history At the outset of this campaign there were some who were convinced that this would be Canada s first true social media election and that we would see the country s political parties roll out innovative social and digital techniques to secure a victory While all of the parties have undoubtedly made use of their various social channels and platforms it would be hard to argue that any of the major parties have rolled out surprisingly new or innovative digital strategies At the same time this election has taught us a great deal about the power of social platforms the lasting impact of comments made online and the rising power of the millennial generation and its shifting attitudes toward brand loyalty and the effect that can have on the major political parties If there was one leader who found an innovative way to use social media to raise her own profile and that of her party it was Green Party Leader Elizabeth May Despite being officially excluded from key national debates Ms May didn t let that stop her from harnessing the power of social media and having her voice heard during the debates In a bold move Ms May leveraged Twitter to not only participate in debates but actually dominate the conversation surrounding the debates online While the debates were going on Ms May s campaign simply recorded video of her answering the same questions that were being put to the other leaders by the debate s moderator then posting them online and to her social profiles Even though she wasn t in the room by inserting herself into the online discussions surrounding the debates as they happened in real time she was able to get the Green Party message out there Although Ms May didn t do anything particularly revolutionary from a technical standpoint she simply used the tools she had to work with a platform equally available to her competitors in a pro active way ensuring that she too had a voice While Ms May came out on top from a social media perspective many other candidates weren t so lucky Indeed this campaign saw several politicians drop out of the race or face harsh criticism over long forgotten comments made on Facebook and Twitter that were unearthed during the campaign As the first digital election there was an opportunity to engage voters in a new way but as we saw time and time again there was also an opportunity to be haunted by tweets of the past From Ala Buzreba s Twitter spat to Joy Davies s pro pot Facebook post Canadians watched repeatedly as the digital tattoos of these candidates were revealed throwing their hopes of election into chaos It was a hard lesson to learn for a handful of politicians this summer but for most it was an important reminder to think twice before you post something online Over time everybody s digital present becomes the record of their past so make sure you keep yours clean Still I can t help but feel that the underutilization of social media in general was a big miss for many Canadian politicians given the mass millennial audience this election saw elxn was expected to be the first federal election in Canada where the millennial generation plays a key role Now making up the biggest generation in the Canadian work force ignoring these young voters could be a fatal mistake for any party leader Especially if the attitudes millennials tend to have toward brand loyalty begin to transfer over to the political process Businesses have learned the hard way that this generation won t just blindly follow a brand out of sheer loyalty Young people today are swayed by ideas sentiment and the bottom line It s entirely possible that traditional voting blocks are disappearing as this younger generation joins the pool Millennials are much more likely to rally around an idea not a party Perhaps that s why election quizzes like the Vote Compass have become so popular unlike previous generations millennials are less likely to enter an election as a devout supporter of any particular party If election forecasts are to be believed the race is tight Which raises the question Is the erosion of brand loyalty bleeding into politics Could this be why none of the parties has been able to break through and take a commanding lead If the Alberta election in May taught us anything it s that nothing is guaranteed until all the ballots have been counted And this election social media played a disappointing role Mia Pearson is the co founder of

SUNNYVALE Calif Oct PRNewswire Because enemy aircraft and missiles can come from anywhere a laser weapon system on a military aircraft will need to be able to fire in any direction However the laws of physics say that a laser only can engage targets in front of an aircraft that is traveling close to the speed of sound unless atmospheric turbulence can be counteracted That s exactly what Lockheed Martin NYSE LMT has done in developing a prototype laser turret for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA and the Air Force Research Laboratory AFRL paving the way for laser weapon systems on tactical aircraft The Aero adaptive Aero optic Beam Control ABC turret is the first turret ever to demonstrate a degree field of regard for laser weapon systems on an aircraft flying near the speed of sound Its performance has been verified in nearly flight tests conducted in and using a business jet as a low cost flying test bed As the aircraft traveled at jet cruise speeds a low power laser beam was fired through the turret s optical window to measure and verify successful performance in all directions The design uses the latest aerodynamic and flow control technology to minimize the impacts of turbulence on a laser beam An optical compensation system which uses deformable mirrors then is used to ensure that the beam can get through the atmosphere to the target Left unchecked turbulence would scatter the light particles that make up a laser beam much like fog diffuses a flashlight beam This advanced turret design will enable tactical aircraft to have the same laser weapon system advantages as ground vehicles and ships said Doug Graham vice president of missile systems and advanced programs Strategic and Missile Defense Systems Lockheed Martin Space Systems This is an example of how Lockheed Martin is using a variety of innovative technologies to transform laser devices into integrated weapon systems DARPA and AFRL will use the results of the flight tests in determining future requirements for laser weapon systems on high speed aircraft and expanding their effectiveness Lockheed Martin is positioning laser weapon systems for success on the battlefield because of their advantages of speed flexibility precision and low cost per engagement The corporation s advances include the development and demonstration of precision pointing and control line of sight stabilization and adaptive optics and high power fiber lasers For additional information visit our website www lockheedmartin com laserweaponsystems About Lockheed Martin Headquartered in Bethesda Maryland Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research design development manufacture integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems products and services The Corporation s net sales for were billion Media Contact Lynn Fisher lynn m fisher lmco com Note to editors A photo is available on our website Approved for public release distribution unlimited Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency This material is based upon work sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency s Strategic Technology Office Aero Adaptive Aero Optical Beam Control System Phase issued by DARPA CMO under Contract No HR C The views expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of Defense or the U S Government SOURCE Lockheed Martin RELATED LINKS http www lockheedmartin com

Samsung s shape shifting Galaxy Tab S is better suited to working on the go Designed for both work and play Samsung s flagship Android tablets are looking more like Apple s iPad than ever The Galaxy Tab S feels impossibly thin and light barely heavier than the slate chalkboards you might have used at primary school if you re old enough to remember such things Along with a slimmer build than last year s model Samsung has also tweaked the Galaxy Tab S s screen to suit people looking to get some work done rather than just consume content In many ways the new Tab S range is only an incremental upgrade from last year s Tab S There s a performance boost thanks to the upgraded Exynos processor but it s still a GHz on Octa Core chip basically two quad core chips running side by side They re accompanied by a generous GB of RAM along with GB of onboard storage up from GB and a micro SD slot for expansion The spec sheet tells a pretty good story You ve got ac Wi Fi Bluetooth and Wi Fi Direct but no NFC The MP rear camera offers improved aperture to enhance low light performance and the new fingerprint reader now lets you press with your finger rather than swipe Advertisement Shape shifter The most notable changes to the Tab S are the screen size and shape bringing it into line with Apple s iPad line up Slightly smaller than the original Tab S the Tab S is available in a choice of or inch displays selling for or respectively depending on whether you want Wi Fi only or the added benefit of G mobile broadband Some people will snigger at Samsung for falling into line with Apple but you have to admit that the iPad s form factor has clearly found success inversely the iPhone has copied more and more aspects of Samsung s smartphones over the years When it comes to tablets Samsung narrowly retains the mine s smaller than yours bragging rights Both Tab S models are mm thick shaving half a millimetre off the iPad They re also also slightly lighter than the corresponding Apple tablets with Samsung s offerings tipping the scales at and grams respectively Like smartphones it seems we re reaching the tablet singularity a convergence in hardware design where it s becoming harder to tell them apart Tablets are so slender that they re becoming all but invisible you can easily forget you re holding one once you become immersed in what s happening on the screen The Galaxy Tab S s screen looks phenomenal sticking with the exquisite Super AMOLED displays that we expect from Samsung It s bright vivid and crisp with very white whites The screen offers wide viewing angles albeit with a slight blue tinge when you re off centre Samsung s Adaptive Display setting adjusts the screen for any conditions and it does a decent job of handling outdoor glare Samsung has also upgraded its SideSync screen mirroring feature letting you view the Tab S s home screen on your PC or Mac You can also mirror the Tab S to a Samsung Smart TV Alternatively you can mirror a Samsung Smart TV or smartphone to the Tab S Productivity boost Along with new screen sizes the Galaxy Tab S tablets have also switched to an iPad esque aspect ratio so they re shaped less like a movie screen and more like a sheet of paper With this change comes a slight drop in screen resolution and pixel density The change in aspect ratio might frustrate people looking for a multimedia companion but it s likely to appeal to those looking for a productivity tool It s little surprise that the Galaxy Tab S comes with the Android version of Microsoft Office pre installed along with GB of OneDrive cloud storage which is free for two years The Tab S also supports Samsung s optional Book Cover Keyboard featuring a physical keyboard along with a trackpad in order to mimic a notebook As with last year s model and a few other Samsung devices the Galaxy Tab S supports multi window view to aid with productivity This lets you run two apps side by side in landscape mode or one above the other in portrait mode Press the Recent button and you ll see that compatible apps have a split screen icon in the title bar You can even shift the dividing line between the two apps on the screen Alternatively you can use pop up view shrinking one app and keeping it on top of the other picture in picture style What s really surprising is that the Microsoft Office apps don t work with multi window or pop up view You d think that multi window view would be a non brainer especially considering that Microsoft Office apps on the iPad support side by side mode Hopefully it s on the road map The tablet runs Samsung s TouchWiz Android skin which thankfully has matured with age and is far less annoying and intrusive than it once was Android fans may be disappointed to learn that the Galaxy Tab S doesn t run Android Marshmallow which was released earlier this month Instead it comes with Android pre installed with the promise of an upgrade to Android So what s the verdict There s a lot to like here even though screen size aside the Galaxy Tab S is an incremental upgrade rather than a major overhaul There s plenty of grunt under the bonnet the razor thin design makes it easy to slip in your travel bag and the fantastic Super AMOLED screen ensures it looks great in any environment There s no killer feature here to entice satisfied Galaxy Tab S owners to upgrade unless you re an Android user secretly envious of the iPad s aspect ratio which is rare in the Android world But if you re in the market for a new slab of Android goodness then Samsung s Galaxy Tab S is hard to beat

Those responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight in the skies above Ukraine will answer for it Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has vowed Following a month investigation into the outrage in July last year which concluded the Boeing was all but obliterated by a Russian made missile the prime minister on Wednesday asserted that those who committed this crime must answer for it The Dutch led investigation into the cause of the crash based on a massive cache of debris and examination of the human remains found the plane en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed as a result of the detonation of a warhead above the left hand side of the cockpit Parts of the missile launched from separatist held territory were found in the bodies of three crew in the cockpit all of whom were killed instantly investigators said All people aboard the flight were killed The destruction of MH and the murder of its passengers and crew was a shocking shameful cowardly crime Mr Turnbull told parliament adding that Australians were killed but million Australians mourned This report from the Dutch Air Safety Board will not provide all the answers to all of their questions The demands of justice are yet unmet Mr Turnbull said The investigators stopped short of apportioning blame but were in no doubt that the plane was brought down by a Russian made BUK surface to air missile Russia has denied any responsibility putting forward the alternative theory that the plane was shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet However the Russian Federation has also resisted efforts of the United Nations to establish a Security Council tribunal that would prosecute those responsible using its veto power to reject a resolution moved in July this year The prime minister vowed a separate criminal investigation into the tragedy involving Australia Belgium Malaysia the Netherlands and the Ukraine would continue undaunted We are focussed on all possible options for prosecuting those responsible with a view to securing due punishment for this crime he said We and all the nations whose citizens share our grief are determined to do everything we can no matter how long it takes to identify those responsible and bring them to justice Mr Turnbull said he would write to the families of the Australians killed to assure them that they have the heart felt sympathies of the nation as this process continues He condemned Russia for blocking the UN resolution over prosecution We will not be bullied by Russia he said Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the report released on Tuesday night was another step in the unfinished journey to justice But amid the lingering anger Paul Guard who lost his parents Jill and Roger in the July disaster said he did not blame only Russia I blame Russia partially but not completely There are many other players that are also to blame he said He said it appeared Malaysia Airlines did not have the information needed to make a risk assessment of whether to fly above the war zone Weeks before the disaster Qantas decided it would stop flying over Ukraine I think more could have been done to share the information and intelligence to ensure that the operation of aircraft was safe over that path Qantas chief Alan Joyce said on Wednesday

Think Twice about Android Root Posted Today In recent years the practice of Android rooting that is the process of allowing an Android phone or tablet to bypass restrictions set by carriers operating systems or hardware manufacturers has become increasingly popular Many rooting methods essentially operate by launching an exploit or malicious code against a vulnerability in the Android system Due to the fact that Android systems are so diverse and fragmented and that Android systems have a notoriously long update cycle typically due to the hold time at mobile carriers the window of vulnerabilities is typically very large UC Riverside engineers have found that Android roots can be easily abused This creates the opportunity for business of offering root as a service by many companies but at the same also creates opportunities for attackers to compromise the system using the same exploits Rooting comes with plenty of advantages With full control of the device users can do everything from remove unwanted pre installed software enjoy additional functionalities offered by specialized apps and run paid apps for free But it also comes with potential significant disadvantages an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California Riverside Bourns College of Engineering has found In a first of its kind study of the Android root ecosystem Zhiyun Qian and two student researchers set out to uncover how many types and variations of Android root exploits exist publically and how they differ from ones offered by commercial root providers and find out how difficult it is to abuse the exploits They found that few of the exploits could be detected by mobile antivirus software and that are systematic weaknesses and flaws in the security protection measures offered by commercial root providers that make them susceptible to being stolen and easily repackaged in malware This is a highly unregulated area that we found is ripe for abuse by malware authors looking to gain access to all kinds of personal information Qian said And unfortunately there is not much users can do except hope that a security update gets pushed out quickly by Google vendors and carriers which they usually aren t Qian has outlined the findings in a paper Android Root and its Providers A Double Edged Sword which he will present at the nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Denver from Oct to The paper is co authored by two graduate students working with Qian Hang Zhang and Dongdong She Rooting is a response to that fact that users or mobile phones and tablets are not given full control over their devices In the Apple and iOS ecosystem rooting is known as jailbreaking In this paper Qian focuses on Android because the system is more open and has more developers and models making it a better area for research Development of root exploits generally fall into two categories Individual developers or hackers often identify vulnerabilities develop and make public exploit tools In addition there are commercial companies that develop exploits These take the form of apps which are typically free that users voluntarily download and then click on to activate the exploits This is a really a phenomena in computer history in which users are essentially voluntarily launching attacks against their own devices to gain control Qian said Unfortunately he added as his findings show attackers can acquire such exploits by impersonating a regular user To make matters worse large commercial root providers have a large repository of root exploits which gives attackers a strong incentive to target such providers In his research Qian and the student engineers focused on seven large commercial root providers one of which they studied more in depth They found that one company had more than exploits which they subcategorized into families That figure is almost double the number of exploits they found publically available from individual developers If we were able to do this Qian said hackers can definitely do it too 
Angus Deaton receives Nobel Prize in economics Posted Today Princeton University professor Angus Deaton has been awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for his contributions to understanding consumption at the individual level and in aggregate Deaton the Dwight D Eisenhower Professor of International Affairs and a professor of economics and international affairs in Princeton s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs has been a faculty member at Princeton since A news conference and receptions were held today on the Princeton campus Deaton was honored with the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work in consumption poverty and welfare the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted in announcing the award today The consumption of goods and services is a fundamental part of people s welfare The Laureate Angus Deaton has deepened our understanding of different aspects of consumption the Nobel committee said His research concerns issues of immense importance for human welfare not least in poor countries Deaton s research has greatly influenced both practical policymaking and the scientific community By emphasizing the links between individual consumption decisions and outcomes for the whole economy his work has helped transform modern microeconomics macroeconomics and development economics Deaton said he received word of the award in a a m phone call from the Nobel committee If you re my age and you ve been working for a long time you know this is a possibility Deaton said But you also know there are a huge number of people out there who deserve this That lightning would strike me seemed like a very small probability event It was sort of like Oh my goodness it s really happening Angus Deaton is a brilliant economist whose pioneering research attacks big questions with rigor imagination and daring said Princeton President Christopher L Eisgruber He has deepened our understanding of poverty inequality and human well being in ways that will inform both academic and policy debates for decades to come Angus has been a leader not only in his field but on this campus where he has taught for more than years We are fortunate to have him at Princeton and we are thrilled that he has won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences I am so thrilled for Angus Deaton said Cecilia Rouse dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs This prize represents a lifetime of important contributions to the understanding of consumption poverty and inequality His work is sophisticated and careful but also passionate Beyond that Angus is a tremendous teacher mentor and colleague Congratulations Deaton speaks to a large crowd of media students faculty and staff at a news conference in Richardson Auditorium on Monday afternoon Among the questions What will Deaton do next I would like to get back to work he said Deaton was joined on stage by from right Christopher L Eisgruber Princeton president Cecilia Rouse dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs Janet Currie the Henry Putnam Professor of Economics and Public Affairs and chair of the Department of Economics and Daniel Day assistant vice president for communications Deaton joins several other Princeton faculty members who have received a Nobel Prize in economics in the last two decades including Christopher Sims in Paul Krugman in and Daniel Kahneman in In his office on campus the morning of the announcement Deaton read through congratulatory emails as his office phone and cellphone rang constantly Joined by his wife Anne Case the Alexander Stewart Professor of Economics and Public Affairs he answered questions about an honor that was still sinking in I still feel a little bit like we might pinch ourselves and wake up and I ll be back in bed and it will be an ordinary day Deaton said Deaton a native of the United Kingdom earned his bachelor s degree and Ph D from Cambridge University He taught at Cambridge and the University of Bristol before joining the faculty at Princeton He is a corresponding fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the American Academy of of Arts and Sciences He is a fellow of the Econometric Society and in was the first recipient of the society s Frisch Medal He is also a member of the American Philosophical Society and the National Academy of Sciences Deaton s current research focuses on the determinants of health in rich and poor countries as well as on the measurement of poverty in India and around the world He also maintains a longstanding interest in the analysis of household surveys Deaton s latest book The Great Escape Health Wealth and the Origins of Inequality Princeton University Press explores the story of how beginning years ago some parts of the world sustained progress opening up gaps and setting the state for today s unequal world He s also widely known for publications on the relationship between income and happiness with Kahneman In announcing Deaton s prize the Nobel committee also specifically noted Deaton s paper with John Muellbauer An Almost Ideal Demand System which details a way to provide a reliable picture of demand patterns in society Deaton noted that his focus on individuals and their decisions is important both from an academic and ethical standpoint In the end it s individual peoples well being that counts he said When you re counting the poverty rate in India or the mortality rate in the United States all of those things you re looking at are aggregates But it s one death at a time It s one person at a time who s in poverty It s their lives that are being led In the end I don t think you re ever going to want to get away from the individual A campus celebration At a news conference Monday afternoon the audience of media faculty students administrators and staff reached into the balcony of Richardson Auditorium Deaton was greeted with a standing ovation as he took the stage Eisgruber introduced Deaton as a great economist and a great Princetonian while Rouse read an email from a one of Deaton s former students who said he always stood out as the best professor I had He challenged and pushed me to achieve the impossible Janet Currie the Henry Putnam Professor of Economics and Public Affairs and chair of the Department of Economics described him as enormously funny well read witty frighteningly erudite and very good company Deaton took the lectern joking that he might ask Sims his colleague friend and fellow Nobel laureate to join him on stage to help him through the news conference He expressed his gratitude for the opportunities provided by the University and the Woodrow Wilson School I really want to thank Princeton for what it s done for me and for the place it s provided me to work Deaton said Wonderful students wonderful graduate students wonderful colleagues He noted the influence of his mentor Richard Stone who received the economics prize in whose interest in economic measurement he shares Deaton also emphasized the breadth of his own work and his lifelong interest in connecting disciplines now reflected in changes in academia One of my great joys and it s so well represented at Princeton is the breadth with which the social sciences have come together in recent years he said Now economics is much closer to sociology much closer to politics much closer to demography much closer to philosophy than it s been for a really really long time In response to a question Deaton noted the tremendous progress that has been made in conditions around the world I ve spent a lot of time arguing the world is getting to be a much better place Deaton said Over the past years the world has been transformed from something close to destitution to where many many of us have much richer lives in which our talents and capabilities can be more fully expressed I do tend to emphasize there s more to be done Other questions focused on the importance of government funding for social sciences progress against poverty in Latin America and the danger of inequality around the world At one of two receptions honoring Deaton following the news conference Provost David S Lee said as a Princeton graduate student he had taken a course with Deaton and consulted with him about his dissertation which focused on inequality He has always been a very generous and accessible professor with a lot of really interesting ideas Lee said He is very influential in the world of economics of course but also here at Princeton Currie said Deaton has had an enormous influence on doctoral students at Princeton who have gone one to become part of the academy He taught my first year graduate course in econometrics He was a very effective teacher Of that class I think we had a much higher than average number of people who went on to become academics and a lot of them were doing work that was applied in some way using data in the way that he taught us Congratulations flooded in about the news of the prize from Deaton s former students and colleagues Duncan Thomas who was a graduate student under Deaton and is now the Norb F Schaefer Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Duke University noted Deaton s impact He has an exceptional ability to help students make the most of themselves and help them develop into the most productive scientists they can possibly be both by encouraging them to see the critical importance of asking questions that matter and then working hard

Posted by pbritt on Oct th in Featured Stories comments There are many reasons that merchants consumers and businesses should consider accepting crypto currency payments Melanie Swan founder and CEO of the Institute for Blockchain Studies told the audience at the recent Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Payments Symposium Some larger merchants including Overstock Newsegg DISH and Expedia already accept Bitcoin and more are expected to accept blockchain based payments soon according to Swan Beyond acceptance by large merchants Swan sees a large potential market for the small payments which are expensive in terms of overhead for payments providers interchange for merchants for credit card payments and for consumers in terms of fees She is looking to a couple of different technology companies to provide consumer ready applications so consumers can easily use blockchain currencies without needing to know how the blockchain works The other advantage that blockchain based payments offer is the immediacy of payment which is truly real time just like cash It s like e mail money or skype for money Swan said She added that Bitcoin has gained trust of users There are hacking scandals that go with the space Swan admitted However by making the blockchain software open sourced code any such scandals are quickly discovered and rectified So Bitcoin has gained trust that it didn t have when it was initially launched However block chain currencies do carry a fluctuation risk not typical of cash or card based payment transactions except for the cross border transactions that carry exchange rate risk Like dealing in foreign transactions any blockchain based payments that aren t immediately converted to cash can be worth more or less at a future time Share this

By Jacopo Prisco for CNN Updated GMT HKT October photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones Fleets of drones carrying crucial goods such as medicine will soon streak the skies of Rwanda putting the small east central African country at the forefront of a technological revolution Designed to be cheap simple and robust the drones will have payloads of up to kg lb while the droneports will function as hubs to allow recharging cargo loading and dropoff as well as repairs With the project expected to break ground in a functioning drone delivery network could be in place as early as Hide Caption of photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones The project is the brainchild of Jonathan Ledgard head of the Afrotech project at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology EPFL and world renowned British architect Norman Foster I went to Norman because I knew that there was no one else on the planet better suited than him to design this Ledgard told CNN I said you designed the largest airport in the world now build me the smallest Hide Caption of photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones The buildings are designed to be extremely easy to construct with architects Forster Partners leveraging on their experience with airports they created the world s largest airport terminal in Beijing as well as more outlandish projects such as one involving a D printed moon base that they designed with the European Space Agency All the raw materials will be sourced on site reducing transportation costs with the droneport consisting of a kit of parts that can be easily assembled by local communities Hide Caption of photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones Rwanda s challenging geographical and social landscape makes it an ideal test bed for the Droneport project said Norman Foster while presenting the initiative which he reckons could have a massive impact through the century and save lives immediately Hide Caption of photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones The droneport itself will be a mix between a railway station a petrol station a blacksmith shop and a post office said Ledgard who points out that the network will provide distribution hubs rather the a last mile delivery infrastructure Nobody cares about the last mile in Africa he says highlighting the difference between the droneport idea and what Amazon and other vendors are planning to do with drones in Western markets where unmanned aerial vehicles are touted to be the next innovative step in the final delivery of consumer goods of any type including pizza Hide Caption of photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones Each droneport will take two to three years to build at a projected cost of about We wanted a concept that was really cheap said Ledgard and the drones themselves will contain a tiny amount of super high tech and a lot of low tech Built to be robust economical and simple to repair they will be powered by electric engines and have a fixed wing design more closely resembling commercial planes rather than quadrocopters Hide Caption of photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones The idea could have a great impact on the local economies of developing African countries This is a multi billion dollar industry without question said Ledgard For the initial applications the team is looking at blood for transfusions and other life giving supplies such as pharmaceuticals But the network could then extend to perishable goods and e commerce purchases Hide Caption of photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones Droneports aren t intended to replace road networks in Africa but increase their capacity Road systems are going to improve a bit in the future but not enough to move the economy along said Ledgard But even increasing your transportation capacity by a small percentage can be beneficial especially for high value perishable goods Hide Caption of photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones While the project is progressing rapidly Ledgard offers a word of caution We want to emphasize that there are still a lot of questions he said But we re making good progress We intend to break ground next year and I would be very disappointed it if we didn t Hide Caption of photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones Two types of drones have been designed with a larger version capable of a kg payload to enter service in a second phase around They will fly at a projected speed of about km h over lakes rivers and mountain ridges and offer extremely competitive costs compared to road transportation Hide Caption of photos Rwanda to get world s first airport for drones For the network to be functional three droneports are needed and they would be able to cover a significant portion of rural Rwanda Ledgard whose intimate knowledge of the continent also comes from a decade of work as news correspondent from troubled areas envisions the idea to soon expand to other countries with Angola Congo Ethiopia Nigeria and C te d Ivoire as ideal candidates But the droneports would be useful outside of Africa as well wherever road networks are limited such as in Siberia parts of Brazil and Argentina Canada and even the North of Scotland Hide Caption of A futuristic network of droneports that will help distribute pharmaceuticals and other crucial goods is set to open soon in the small African republic of Rwanda The projects unites the architectural expertise of British firm Foster Partners and the engineering ingenuity of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology EPFL in Lausanne Construction is set to begin next year with operations starting as early as Flick through the gallery to see what the droneport will look like and find out more about how it will work 
Watching BBC today I saw what Hiroshima looked like immediately after the bomb Totally destroyed So many dead Some have gone so far as to call it a war crime Evidence has surfaced that the bomb was used after Japan was on the ropes Not at all what we were led to believe This kindled a feint flicker of a memory Of a time when the leader of Pakistan said that they would eat grass if they had to but we would never abandon the nuclear program This was in defense of the massive drain that the nuclear program represented And the total destruction of the fabric of their society and the ensuing poverty it represented I am not suggesting that Pakistan is a failed state and that this was a result of a generation of taxes sunk onto the search for nuclear weapons and other interesting projects That would be an over simplification of a much more complex matter I am however counting Pakistan amongst the casualties of nuclear weapons The poverty fertile ground for all kinds of crazy all a result of nuclear weapons and the mad dash to develop them at any cost If we expand the definition of countries destroyed by nuclear weapons to include countries that battered their own economies to shreds in the pursuit of these weapons Weapons that could never should never be used We might see a lot more people in that queue So many people impoverished health care systems decimated from lack of funding infant mortality returning to dark ages while the wealth of a generation was ground to the dust Dust the was then fed to the centrifuge All for a weapon that could never be used Not ever They are not alone in this North Korea Iran and a host of other wealthy nations rich in potential pissed it all away in the pursuit of nuclear weapons It is clear that the weapons were destructive to places like Hiroshima and Nagasaki that experienced the barrel end but less is known about destruction to countries that broke their backs in pursuit of the weapons Some would argue that even those countries who seemed to succeed with their programs while keeping their economies from imploding even they were victims Their economies and quality of life were also thrown into the centrifuge Almost as if they blew themselves up and their countries lay in ruin post apocalyptic ruin by their own hands Without the mushroom clouds to tell them what hit them It reminds me of the honour virus that I got a few years ago You have just received the honour virus Because we don t have any computers or programming experience this virus works on the honor system Please delete all the files from your hard drive and manually forward this virus to everyone on your mailing list Thank you for your cooperation

New Graphene Oxide Biosensors May Accelerate Research of HIV and Cancer Drugs Posted Today Longing to find a cure for cancer HIV and other yet incurable diseases researchers have already tried out hundreds of drugs each requiring preclinical and clinical testing with live subjects How many chemical agents more to try Moving at such rate will we find the cure during our lifetime Researchers from the Laboratory of Nanooptics and Plasmonics Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology MIPT Russia have devised a novel type of graphene oxide GO based biosensor that could potentially significantly speed up the process of drug development One of the easiest ways to speed up the drug development process is to simply perform it outside of the living body e g by watching the substances react with the smallest pieces of live tissue and thus quickly predicting the overall effect it will make to the body when inside This approach will eventually provide more effective preclinical selection of drug candidates for the subsequent long term and expensive clinical trial This could get the humanity closer to finding the cures we ve long been seeking for Researchers from the Laboratory of Nanooptics and Plasmonics Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology MIPT Russia have devised a novel type of graphene oxide GO based biosensor that could potentially significantly speed up the process of drug development The outstanding properties of this carbon allotrope help to improve significantly the biosensing sensitivity which in future may enable the development of new drugs and vaccines against many dangerous diseases including HIV hepatitis and cancer The research led by Yury Stebunov a scientist at the MIPT was published in the ACS Applied Materials Interfaces The paper is titled Highly sensitive and selective sensor chips with graphene oxide linking layer Valentyn Volkov is the co lead author a visiting professor from the University of Southern Denmark Other co authors are Olga Aftenieva and Aleksey Arsenin New GO based biosensor chips exploit the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance SPR Surface plasmons are electromagnetic waves propagating along a metal dielectric interface e g gold air and having the amplitudes exponentially decaying in the neighbor media Adsorption of molecules from solution onto a sensing surface alters the refractive index of the medium near this surface and therefore changes the conditions of SPR These sensors can detect biomolecule adsorption even at a few trillionth of a gram per millimeter square Owing to the above mentioned merits SPR biosensing is an outstanding platform to boost technological progress in the areas of medicine and biotechnology Nevertheless the most distinctive feature of such sensors is an ability to visualize molecular interactions in real time SPR biosensing is a valuable tool to investigate a wide range of biochemical reactions estimate their chemical kinetics and other characteristics All this can be efficiently used for new drug discovery and validation Widespread introduction of this method into preclinical trials will completely change the pharmaceutical industry With SPR sensors we just need to estimate the interaction between the drug and targets on the sensing surface Stebunov said Most commercial SPR sensor chips comprise a thin glass plate covered by gold layer with thiol or polymer layers on it The biosensing sensitivity depends on the properties of chip surface Higher binding capacity for biomolecules increases the signal levels and accuracy of analysis The last several years novel carbon materials like graphene have attracted much attention due to their large surface area low cost fabrication and interaction with a wide range of biomolecules Stebunov and the team from the Laboratory of Nanooptics and Plasmonics at MIPT created and patented a novel type of SPR sensor chips with the linking layer made of GO a material with more attractive optical and chemical properties than pristine graphene The GO flakes were deposited on the nm gold layer Thereafter a layer of streptavidin protein was developed on GO for selective immobilization of biomolecules Scientists conducted a series of experiments with the GO chip the commercially available chip with carboxymethylated dextran CMD layer and the chip covered by monolayer graphene Experiments showed that the proposed GO chip has three times higher sensitivity than the CMD chip and times than the chip with pristine graphene These results mean that the new chip needs much less molecules for detecting a compound and can be used for analysis of chemical reactions with small drug molecules An important advantage of the new GO based sensor chips is their simplicity and low cost fabrication compared to sensor chips that are already commercially available Our invention will help in drug development against viral and cancer diseases We are expecting that pharmaceutical industry will express a strong demand for our technology Stebunov said The sensor can also find applications in food quality control toxin screening the sensor can significantly shorten a time for a clinical diagnostic researcher added However the developed chip should go through a clinical trial for medical applications

This article was posted on Raising the bar for power supply efficiencies The estimated million devices connected to the grid by will require improved efficiency and reduced vampire loading of not in use devices to maintain a healthy electric grid BY MICHAEL FREEMAN CEO www semitrex com The Internet of Things IoT is gaining momentum However before the estimated billion new IoT devices are attached together greater standby efficiencies are needed Currently there are about billion electronic devices connected through a network to datacenters The IEA estimates that number will grow to billion by as more residential appliances such as refrigerators microwaves washer dryers and dishwashers become network connected as well All of these devices draw power even when not in use this is known as a vampire load energy use from electronic devices plugged into the wall but not in use also known as stand by power A recent Forbes article stated that the world wastes terawatt hours TWh of energy per year due to vampire loading Many companies are trying to solve this world wide problem One solution Muxcapacitor MXC technology reduces vampire loads by increasing stand by mode efficiency The upcoming Department of Energy Level VI regulations will require stand by power on smaller than W devices to be no more than mW Through using multiple cascaded capacitor banks MXC technology is able to shut down enough banks when a device is inactive to achieve a stand by power of mW which is times more efficient than the DOE standard see Fig Fig The MXC technology reduces vampire loads to achieve a stand by power x more efficient than the DOE standard In addition to government regulations of stand by power there is a demand from governments and consumers alike for electronic devices that are more energy efficient when in use Consumers want to reduce their monthly energy bills while governments and utility companies want to limit the demand on the grid to reduce the potential for brown outs or rolling blackouts This potential will increase with the additional burden of IoT devices Traditional transformer based power conversion has been around since the s but due to the to or so discrete parts that are typically used in connection with traditional transformer designs the industry has only made incremental improvements to efficiency These transformer voltage reduction power supply systems rely on inductors which use magnetic fields for voltage reductions from the mains However magnetic fields lose electrons as they build and collapse causing the transformer powered device to become hot to the touch due to the wasted lost energy The design improvements made to metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors MOSFETs have required the technology to become increasingly dense over the years which has increased heat generation Often these systems now require a heat sink or other cooling apparatus to ensure that there is no damage to the electronic device Other efficiency efforts to reduce core losses and increase the energy efficiency of transformers include a larger core made from more expensive materials This increases the up front cost of the equipment and a trade off is made for the increased efficiency Capacitive voltage reduction is the first breakthrough power supply technology since the transformer This technology traps the electrons within capacitors via transistor gates then releases the electrons only when the gates are open This reduces the loss of electrons as heat and therefore increases efficiency Previously capacitors were mainly relegated for use in line conditioning applications to reduce power dips and improve power quality Semitrex has repurposed the capacitor technology to handle the primary voltage conversion in its patented modularized TRONIUM Power Supply System on a Chip MXC technology uses capacitive voltage reduction methods that have small energy conversion ratios This is far more energy efficient than standard transformer technology which uses large conversion ratios The mux in Muxcapacitor refers to the many channels of energy coming from the bank of small capacitors embedded into the silicon chip Each capacitor is responsible for a small conversion ratio which means it is able to transfer almost all of the electrons without energy loss The capacitors only sustain a small portion of the input voltage and therefore only support a small portion of the output current This allows for high efficiency even at small loads Inductors in contrast have to sustain the full voltage and current and therefore see less efficiency Capacitors also benefit from a much higher energy density than inductors The MXC efficiency gains are due to a series of cascading capacitors controlled through interconnected transistor gates At mA of current in a V system MXC technology is efficient and goes up to efficiency at A and above see Fig This is in contrast to a typical flyback converter which can t handle that small a current and maxes out at efficiency As stated above MXC technology is able to achieve mW of stand by power The series of small capacitors allows the system to shut down most of the capacitor banks so only a few are active to sense the next charge or on off event Fig The modularized TRONIUM Power Supply System on a Chip uses capacitive voltage reduction methods and provides up to efficiency at A MXC has better stand by power load increased efficiency and does not get hot to the touch In fact the entire TRONIUM Power Supply System seeks to reduce the energy footprint and cuts the number of different components in half from an average of with its modular approach MXC technology is mostly embedded in the chip along with the algorithms switches and gate technologies necessary for power conversion and regulation The modular power supply system further helps to reduce the energy footprint by streamlining the manufacturing process and eliminating many fabrication steps Any electronic device requiring stand by power can become more energy efficient using MXC technology Applications for this technology are many and varied from chargers for cell phones and laptops to residential household appliances industrial electronics medical devices telecom and hand held devices and data centers The low conversion ratios of MXC technology also make it more useful than inductor technology in FET gates embedded switches and passive elements MXC capacitive voltage reduction has the ability to significantly reduce worries about IoT vampire loads and sets a new bar

Chicago s move to extend its taxing power to Internet streaming services like Netflix and Spotify has been challenged in court by a group that argues the city didn t have the authority to create what amounts to new taxes In a lawsuit filed this week in Cook County Circuit Court the nonprofit Liberty Justice Center says the city Finance Department s rulings in June extending two taxes were illegal The department posted letters online announcing that the city was extending the percent amusement tax to include paid subscriptions for streamed digital music rental movies TV shows and games and also extending the personal property lease transaction tax to professional services like electronic property databases used by real estate agents The ruling applied the new standards to subscribers with Chicago addresses and city officials said they expected the changes to bring in about million annually in the latest example of Mayor Rahm Emanuel boosting various smaller fees and fines to try to help close the city s gaping budget hole The lawsuit argues that aldermen should have gotten to vote on the changes The Comptroller has exceeded his authority under the ordinance by issuing a rule that imposes a new tax that the City Council did not authorize in enacting the Amusement Tax the suit reads No aldermen voted on this tax It never went before the Chicago City Council which makes the so called Netflix tax an illegal tax Jeffrey Schwab an attorney with the Liberty Justice Center said in a news release Thursday If the city wants to tax Internet based streaming media services then it should put the measure through the political process and let Chicagoans have their voices heard through the democratic process Chicago extends taxing power to online movies music more John Byrne and Amina Elahi Chicagoans who pay to stream movies and music from services like Netflix and Spotify will now need to fork over an additional percent for the privilege as will Chicago businesses that pay to use everything from real estate to court databases online under a decision the city quietly made recently Chicagoans who pay to stream movies and music from services like Netflix and Spotify will now need to fork over an additional percent for the privilege as will Chicago businesses that pay to use everything from real estate to court databases online under a decision the city quietly made recently John Byrne and Amina Elahi The suit also argues that the levies violate the federal Internet Freedom Tax Act because they tax some Internet based streaming media at a higher rate than similar services not delivered via the Internet The city s Law Department released a statement saying it intends to vigorously fight the lawsuit The City has not yet seen the complaint but we are confident that the ruling is a valid application of the existing Amusement Tax department spokesman John Holden said in an emailed statement Emanuel has turned repeatedly to increasing smaller taxes and fees to help fill the city s coffers In May he introduced a plan to require off site parking companies at Chicago s airports to share their revenue with the city in exchange for pickup privileges at O Hare and Midway airports The mayor also has raised fees for parking at downtown garages and cable TV and telephone line service taxes among others jebyrne tribpub com City delays business side of controversial cloud tax until Jan Amina Elahi The start date for the business end of the so called cloud tax that drew ire from Chicagoans and tech companies last month is being pushed back to Jan the city said Friday Businesses were to be on the hook for collecting percent taxes on streaming and cloud based services starting Sept The start date for the business end of the so called cloud tax that drew ire from Chicagoans and tech companies last month is being pushed back to Jan the city said Friday Businesses were to be on the hook for collecting percent taxes on streaming and cloud based services starting Sept Amina Elahi Twitter johnbyrne Spotify Politics and Government

Submitted by admin on AM ViiMed WASHINGTON Oct PRNewswire The COPD Foundation and ViiMed announced the launch of COPD coach this week at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Amsterdam COPD coach is the brainchild of a Crowdshaped event co hosted by the COPD Foundation and Novartis Pharmaceuticals back in early June The collaborative effort convened a diverse range of mindsets knowledge backgrounds and experiences in order to enhance patient centered care for those affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD COPD is a respiratory disease affecting approximately million Americans and is the third leading cause of death in United States In order to bring the ideas from the open thinking session to fruition the COPD Foundation the only U S healthcare nonprofit dedicated to preventing and curing COPD conducted a nationwide technology search They selected the innovative team at ViiMed the leader in asynchronous telehealth and care coordination to develop a solution combining what was derived from Crowdshaped into one cohesive platform Together they are offering an exceptional platform for Health Systems and Accountable Care Organizations ACO to deploy to their patients in an effort to help patients better manage their disease Having been eagerly awaited since the project s conception in mid July COPD coach is an interactive website and mobile application for health coaching health education and wellness monitoring for patients with COPD The platform complements and enhances healthcare organizations existing care management solutions by enabling a coordinated and asynchronous peer coaching infrastructure This approach further guides empowerment of people with COPD utilizing educational modules comprised of online videos and courses taught by health professionals and real COPD patients all while providing an extended care coordination backbone for the Health System or ACO We are so excited to bring COPD coach to people with COPD All the terrific ideas that emerged from Crowdshaped are being put into action Collaborating with ViiMed team has truly amplified these ideas and the ViiMed technology platform is the perfect venue for our innovation to come to life ViiMed s outside looking in approach to virtual care will not only help make the lives of people with COPD better but also enable healthcare organizations to scale and personalize patient empowerment said John Walsh President and Co Founder of the COPD Foundation When asked to discuss specifics around the Foundation s COPD coach ViiMed s CEO Phil Newman said COPD Foundation s existing initiatives COPD social and its COPD Patient Powered Research Network COPD PPRN are making a difference today for thousands of people with COPD and our team at ViiMed is honored to extend that effort by bringing the care delivery element COPD coach to life To drive empowerment for a person with COPD or anyone with a chronic disease we need to personalize the on going relationships between the care team and the person with COPD especially in the virtual environment The connections between everyone loved ones peer coaches care managers nurse practitioners or physicians needs to be personal making every interaction meaningful and further guiding behavior change He continued by adding the importance of enabling Health Systems and ACOs to extend this experience to every person with COPD COPD coach scales care teams through its asynchronous video centric approach Together the Foundation and ViiMed have the opportunity to facilitate Health Systems and ACOs helping so many more people with COPD and we are going to work hard to see that happen Personalized interactions support a person with COPD while COPD coach s layered coordination capabilities help drive better outcomes by spotting trends before unfavorable results occur Being a person with COPD and a peer coach I am so excited to see the COPD coach approach in action Yes the healthcare community needs to track outcomes and data along the journey and COPD coach will obviously do that through devices education and other quantifiable methods but to center engagement around personalized relationships between providers peer coaches and persons with COPD in this unique way will strengthen the necessary bond that truly changes behavior or provide that timely reinforcement outlet when it s needed said Karen Erickson the Associate Executive Director of Community Engagement at the Alpha Foundation We are very excited to be able to offer this innovative approach to managing COPD to the healthcare community The COPD Foundation is striving to integrate technology into care plans while at the same time retaining a personal touch COPD coach synthesizes best practices with clear informative and personalized coaching said Walsh He continued I am pleased that through our collaboration with ViiMed we can propel our mission to improving the lives of those living with this devastating disease About the COPD Foundation The COPD Foundation s mission is to prevent and cure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and improve the lives of all

Charles Miller gave a FISO presentation today I didn t call in but the MP seems to be available here I m having trouble getting it to play but you may have better luck Post navigation thoughts on To Mars Via The Moon gbaikie says I didn t listen to whole thing But generally I think it s good Maybe I will listen to rest later But I don t think NASA should do a lunar base even with commercial partnership Instead NASA should focus on Lunar exploration and lunar exploration should focused on finding minable lunar water And the a major part of lunar exploration is related to minable lunar water in sense that NASA exploration uses orbital depots Once orbital depots reach operational status by using it for Lunar exploration this technology would also be useful for Mars exploration and commercial water mining And also related to commercial satellite operations and asteroid mining And NASA does not wait or is dependent on commercial Lunar water mining And it s possible other countries might focus on lunar bases once NASA has explored the moon to determine where and if lunar water is minable And if like commerical lunar mining if other countries have lunar bases this also provides political support for the decades of exploration needed to determine if and where human settlements could be on Mars

Questions answers about effort to hack Clinton s emails By Associated Press October am WASHINGTON AP Russia linked hackers tried at least five times in August to trick Hillary Rodham Clinton into infecting her computer systems while she was secretary of state according to newly released emails from the State Department Here are important things to know WHAT DID THE HACKERS DO They sent to Clinton s email account at least five notices that appeared to originate from a New York City government address The emails pretended to inform her that the state Department of Motor Vehicles had caught her speeding more than mph a month earlier and instructing her to open an attached file Ticket Zip to print the ticket and mail it with payment But opening the file attachment would have activated malicious software known as malware that would have quietly implanted on her systems a program to spy on her activities and allow hackers to install other programs without her awareness WAS CLINTON ACTUALLY HACKED It is not known It s unclear whether Clinton was fooled into opening the attachments which could have infected her systems and compromised the security of her email account Clinton s campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said there was no evidence to suggest that Clinton replied to the emails or opened the attachments The speed ticket emails appeared authentic enough to fool plenty of Internet users and Clinton has described herself as technically unsophisticated But Clinton said just days ago when asked whether hackers from Russia or China could have broken into her server There s no evidence of that Also there is some evidence that the malware targeted Windows users and Clinton was known to prefer using an iPad during this period The security of Clinton s private email system including the server in the basement of her home in Chappaqua N Y has been an important question since Clinton acknowledged in March that she had used it for all official government business as secretary of state The fact that these infected emails were delivered to Clinton even if she didn t infect herself suggests that security protections and email filters on her homebrew server were weak or missing WERE THE HACKERS FROM RUSSIA It s easy for hackers to disguise their origins Security researchers determined that some of the malicious software sent to Clinton in communicated with rogue servers in Russia but that doesn t necessarily mean Russian hackers were behind the plot The rogue servers appear to be no longer operating The hackers responsible were never identified or captured WAS CLINTON HERSELF TARGETED BY THE HACKERS So many Internet users were receiving the same speeding ticket ruse that New York State police and others began openly warning about the ploy as early as June two months before Clinton received the messages But it s still a significant mystery how the hackers knew to send emails to Clinton s private server address she used for State Department business since in it was still a secret email address to most of the world Roughly two years later the email account belonging to an informal adviser to Clinton Sidney Blumenthal was hacked by a Romanian Marcel Lehel Guccifer Lazar who is serving a seven year prison sentence Emails released from that hack in included the first public references to Clinton s private email address WASN T THIS JUST SPAM WHY HAVEN T WE SEEN MORE SPAM IN CLINTON S EMAILS RELEASED SO FAR BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT The five unwanted emails delivered to Clinton weren t spam these were malicious software with dangerous payloads It s possible there were additional unwanted messages in Clinton s email account that she deleted before turning over the work related emails to the State Department So how did these emails survive The hackers designed these five messages to appear to be sent from a New York City government account nyc gov so it s likely that Clinton mistakenly preserved them under the notion that these were government messages BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVEN T DRIVEN THEIR OWN CARS IN MANY YEARS WHY WOULD CLINTON BE TEMPTED TO CLICK OPEN WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SPEEDING TICKET This was a clever ruse by hackers designed to pique any recipient s curiosity or outrage about the possibility of paying a fine for speeding In this case the speeding tickets purported to be in New York where the family owns a home and where Clinton served as U S senator Copyright The Associated Press All rights reserved This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

Ask a roomful of people to take out their phones and you re bound to see several with cracked screens Despite engineering breakthroughs screen breakage has become a part of life the leading type of phone damage In part we re to blame We want phones that are bigger yet thinner offsetting strides made in strengthening glass We also want phones to be sleek A phone that s rugged enough to withstand drops just won t match what we expect smartphones to look and feel like The tradeoff is phones get a lot bigger and bulkier said Rick Osterloh president of phone maker Motorola Without a really big innovation and technological breakthrough it s going to be hard to make a really tough phone in a size people expect That s not to say phones aren t getting stronger In fact given how frequently we use phones throughout the day juggling them as we commute run errands and chase after small children it s amazing screens don t crack even more The latest phones from the two leading phone makers Apple s iPhone s and s Plus and Samsung s Galaxy Note and S Edge Plus mix zinc into the aluminum frames for aerospace grade strength The frames will absorb more of the shock that would have gone to the glass not to mention help prevent the phones from bending in pockets Phone Glass Gets Stronger But Cracking Persists Smartphone manufacturers are strengthening touchscreen glass to better withstand dropping bending and falling objects But will stronger glass lead to fewer broken phones Sept Smartphone manufacturers are strengthening touchscreen glass to better withstand dropping bending and falling objects But will stronger glass lead to fewer broken phones Sept See more videos The displays also use ion strengthened glass Samsung uses Corning s Gorilla Glass which gets heated in a process that replaces sodium ions on the surface with potassium ions Because potassium ions are larger they press together to create a stronger surface akin to a layer of armor to protect the interior Apple turned to Corning for a custom glass that goes through two rounds of ion exchange for greater strength Even some budget and mid range phones including Motorola s are now using strengthened glass though made with older weaker formulas With strengthened glass you can still pierce the armor with enough pressure but it s harder than with normal glass SquareTrade which offers protection plans for consumer electronics said that while phone screens used to crack after one or two drops the latest iPhones and the Note survived drops each from six feet in tests last weekend at least when dropped on their corners SquareTrade also said the new iPhone screens are more durable than last year s models It didn t test the Note s predecessor for comparison Chicago is city that works while on vacation Meg Graham Michael Douglas once said Hollywood is hype New York is talk Chicago is work Turns out he s right at least about Chicago A recent report by Bank of America found that only percent of Chicagoans shut down their mobile phones during vacation with percent of people accessing them for Michael Douglas once said Hollywood is hype New York is talk Chicago is work Turns out he s right at least about Chicago A recent report by Bank of America found that only percent of Chicagoans shut down their mobile phones during vacation with percent of people accessing them for Meg Graham But for all three new phones the screens broke right away when dropped face down on concrete The stronger glass improves the odds but the risk isn t zero Scott Forester director of innovations for Gorilla Glass said Corning has made strides in withstanding the types of surfaces most likely to puncture glass including asphalt and concrete But he said that s offset by glass getting thinner and screens bigger over the years in response to consumer demand It s always this fine balance between practicality and design Forester said SquareTrade said half of its damage claims are for screen cracks That doesn t include cracked phones people hang onto because they don t want to pay a deductible Melissa Lefas has dropped her iPhone s a few times but its screen survived until the phone slipped out of an open backpack while she was carrying groceries and leaning over to unlock a bike It landed on a New York sidewalk made of stone a jagged surface perfect for puncturing glass I heard it and knew it was a goner she said I ve seen so many people with cracked screens I felt it was a matter of time Aware of consumers frustrations with breakage HTC is offering one free replacement for any damage including cracks to its HTC One smartphone within the first year Unlike standard warranties accidents are covered For other phones we might simply have to get a case insurance or both Cases offer no guarantees but they help When Ben Wilson s iPhone fell out of a private plane he was co piloting at feet the case shattered but the phone survived It helped that the phone landed on a pasture in northern Texas rather than a stone sidewalk It surprised me Wilson said talking on that still functioning phone nearly two weeks later I thought it would be in quite a few pieces Can more be done What about ditching glass for something stronger Plastic is one candidate but it s prone to scratching Then there s sapphire a mineral that s just short of diamond in hardness It s extremely scratch resistant but its resistance to cracking is up for debate It s also tough to manufacture especially in larger sizes for phone screens Apple uses sapphire for the smaller displays found on pricier Apple Watch models as well as for the home button and camera lens cover on iPhones The material used isn t the only factor in durability Apple has received a patent for using internal motors to rotate a phone as it drops so that the glass part doesn t hit the ground There s no word though on when we might see this in iPhones It might ultimately come down to priorities Yes people want phones that don t crack but they also want better cameras and better video playback not to mention a sleeker design Manufacturers have to innovate in all of those areas I give manufacturers a lot of credit for continually striving to make durability a major component of their new designs said Jessica Hoffman a spokeswoman for SquareTrade However it just seems they can t keep up with us Associated Press Apple iPhone Apple Watch Samsung Galaxy Note

PyroGenesis to enter D printing market will produce powders for additive manufacturing With million investment company says it could be producing powders within nine months October Cleantech MONTREAL PyroGenesis Canada Inc a cleantech firm that has focused on the development and sale of plasma waste to energy systems and plasma torch products has announced it will be diving into the fast growing additive manufacturing industry as well After filing a provisional patent for its Plasma Atomization Process earlier this year PyroGenesis now says it will begin producing specialty powders for D printing The process produces highly flowable and very pure spherical metallic powders ideal for D printing the company said While delivering the first of ten Plasma Atomization Systems to a client an opportunity arose to test certain parameters which PyroGenesis identified as having the potential of improving both the production rate and purity of the powders Peter Pascali president and CEO of PyroGenesis said The decision was taken with the customer to strategically delay delivering the first system to allow for this testing This strategic delay not only resulted in a patent application by PyroGenesis but paved the way for PyroGenesis to consider producing powder for D printing on its own The company said it has already identified customers interested in buying powders though not in the quantity that would justify the purchase of a dedicated system The company estimates it could generate more than million in profit per year from each system s powder sales As a result the company is in the process of securing funds to finance the venture The Montreal based company said with an investment of million it could be producing powders within nine months Share This Post

Response to environmental change depends on individual variation in partnership between corals and algae October by Sam Sholtis Elkhorn coral in Bonaire Credit Jessica Levy Coral Restoration Foundation New research reveals that some corals are more protective than others of their partner algae in harsh environmental conditions This individual variation among corals could reflect a greater capacity than currently recognized to adapt to changing ocean conditions brought about by climate change The study led by marine biologists at Penn State University will be published online October in the open access journal Scientific Reports Our study provides a glimmer of hope that corals can respond to and survive climate change as long as it s not too fast said Iliana Baums associate professor of biology at Penn State The variation in response to extreme temperature that we observed is the raw material for evolutionary change and indicates that these corals may be more adaptable than previously thought Reef building corals depend on single celled algae called Symbiodinium to provide energy through photosynthesis while the algae benefit from the corals nutrients This delicate symbiosis can break down under extreme ocean temperatures associated with climate change said John Parkinson the lead author of the study and a former graduate student at Penn State Just this summer the hottest on record major thermal anomalies in Florida Hawaii and Panama have seriously damaged local reefs which provide essential ecological and economic resources For some time scientists have known that certain combinations of coral and algal species were more tolerant to temperature extremes than others and therefore more likely to survive in the changing conditions predicted for the future But we had no idea if the same dynamic could play out among different combinations of individuals within species said Parkinson Using high resolution DNA markers developed at Penn State that can distinguish individual corals and strains of algae from one another the researchers mapped out host symbiont associations on a reef in Puerto Morelos Mexico They identified six genetically distinct colonies of the Elkhorn coral Acropora palmata that all shared the same strain of algae Then they exposed fragments of the colonies to extreme temperatures and monitored the response of the algae In all hosts the algae suffered due to the stress but the effect was half as intense in some corals compared to others This video is not supported by your browser at this time The beauty of the research is that we were able to disentangle the contribution of the host coral and its symbiotic partner algae in their collective response to environmental pressure said Baums The researchers also monitored changes in gene expression levels an indication of how much a given gene is being used in the corals In cells of the corals that were protective of their partner algae the expression level of genes changed after being exposed to the temperature shock In corals with algae more heavily impacted by the environmental change the expression level changed for only genes Think of it like a couple s dancing competition said Parkinson Who you are paired with really matters for your overall score It is encouraging to the researchers that this is true not only for different mixes of coral and algae species but also for different combinations of individuals within a species This discovery suggests that there is an extra layer of complexity to coral algae symbioses that may prove critical in how they respond to climate change in the long term 
NY College Hands Out Free Personal Safety Devices By Dian Schaffhauser A New York college system is trying out a personal safety device which it handed out to students as they arrived on campuses this fall The Sage Colleges struck an agreement with Peace of Mind Company POMCO to make its new POM available for free The POM is a keychain sized device that promises faster response in an emergency by allowing the student to push a button to get campus safety help To set up the device it s synced with the student s smart phone through Bluetooth and the student must create an account The device connects the user with campus security through a two way call function and records the call Location tracking identifies the user s location and pulls up a profile that may include a photo and personal information When the call is over the student hangs up through the phone The device can also activate an alarm function by tapping it three times doing so is a separate operation that won t contact campus safety The POM needs recharging through a micro USB plug every to days When the charge drops below a certain level the POM goes into sleep mode to preserve the battery so that it can still make an emergency call The company hopes to entice other campuses to adopt the technology by allowing it to be branded with school colors and an image of a mascot or logo Students appreciated Sage making this investment on their behalf and many said they plan to carry the device at all times said Trish Cellemme Sage s vice president for student life in a prepared statement In a video about the handout one student said Just having that device in my pocket on my keychain is going to make me feel safer About the Author Dian Schaffhauser is a writer who covers technology and business for a number of publications Contact her at dian dischaffhauser com

Hands free gadgets create safety hazards for drivers study By Rob Lever Washington AFP Oct Are those hands free tech tools aimed at helping motorists keep their eyes on the road a safety hazard A new study commissioned by the American Automobile Association found that these tools which aim to cut down on distracted motorists driving could be distractions themselves The findings released this week raise fears that motorists who use wireless voice activated tools as they heed warnings about texting and driving may be doing little to improve safety Researchers found that potentially unsafe levels of mental distraction can last for as long as seconds after using some of these tools which allow drivers to send texts and emails or perform other tasks without taking their eyes off the road Drivers should use caution while using voice activated systems even at seemingly safe moments when there is a lull in traffic or the car is stopped at an intersection said Marshall Doney AAA s president and chief executive The reality is that mental distractions persist and can affect driver attention even after the light turns green The study led by the University of Utah for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety rated voice activated systems from vehicle manufacturers as well as Apple s Siri Microsoft s Cortana and Google Now The study found that three systems created moderate levels of cognitive distraction nine led to high levels of distraction and one created a very high distraction level Different cars were associated with varying levels of distractability The lowest level was in the Chevrolet Equinox the highest in the Mazda The researchers found that a driver traveling at miles kilometers per hour continues to be distracted for up to seconds after disconnecting from highly distracting phone and car voice command systems and up to seconds after disconnecting from the moderately distracting systems Just because these systems are in the car doesn t mean it s a good idea to use them while you are driving says University of Utah psychology professor David Strayer who led the research They are very distracting very error prone and very frustrating to use Far too many people are dying because of distraction on the roadway and putting another source of distraction at the fingertips of drivers is not a good idea It s better not to use them when you are driving Singling out technology But Gary Shapiro president of the Consumer Electronics Association said these technologies should not be singled out as the source of distracted driving In vehicle distractions arise from a variety of sources from eating while driving to using paper maps Shapiro said The big overall goal is to reduce distracted driving rather than ignore all controllable factors except for voice recognition he said Technology continues to reduce distractions Voice controls are obviously safer than sitting with a paper map in your lap Shapiro argued that innovation holds the key to safety for drivers and rapidly evolving technology can help make the driving experience even safer

 Oct Cargo Volumes and Throughput Global Economy Trade Going Places Mega Ship Ready Shipping A new report from UNCTAD highlights risks to competition in the container sector specifically for smaller nations whilst the Review of Maritime Transport correctly identifies the growing control of vessel capacity among the leading container lines and goes on to suggest that the search for economies of scale through the introduction of bigger ships explains why there are fewer carriers in individual markets according to Drewry According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD research there is now an average of carriers providing services to each country s ports down from in UNCTAD identified countries mostly small island states with fewer than four carriers calling at their ports up from back in The average vessel size per country will continue to grow and so we expect there will be fewer companies in individual markets and this is an increasing challenge for the smallest players Jan Hoffmann head of trade facilitation at UNCTAD told Reuters While Drewry agrees with the basic thesis that in general countries will be served by fewer carriers in the future we disagree with the drivers of this trend as proposed by the UNCTAD report The rise of the mega ships does not explain why smaller countries such as Samoa or Iceland are less well served as these ships were never intended to call at these more remote outposts They simply lack sufficient volumes to attract more than a handful of lines Read Is Shipping Sailing into a Storm Furthermore as the container carriers first went global and then consolidated many of the smaller North South carriers the South American and the African lines in particular disappeared and were acquired but they were not replaced by new entrants The Hapag Lloyd CSAV combination is the latest example Drewry states that several carriers are now considering entering the African trades as volumes increases and as the number of competitors has decreased The move towards big ships has certainly reduced the number of vessel operators in the major deep sea trades but the industry nonetheless remains extremely competitive which has contributed to the downwards trend in freight rates Read a Technical Paper from Drewry s Neil Davidson on the impact mega ships are having on ports and terminals There are currently vessel operators in the Asia North Europe trade route where most of the Ultra Large Container Vessels ULVCs are deployed down from in However when you add in all of the subsidiary companies and slot charter parties the number of carriers that shippers can approach for business is far higher For example Drewry counts around different carriers offering space between Shanghai and Hamburg Admittedly the number of options will be lower between smaller port pairs Part of the rationale for ordering big ships was to reduce carrier costs something they have had more success with than raising freight rates This coping mechanism might have lowered the number of ship operators but as we ve seen it has not barred smaller lines from entry The biggest risk to competition within the industry in our opinion comes from the sustained low freight rates that produce extremely thin profit margins and are forcing some carriers to cut their cloth accordingly Some carriers no longer want to be global carriers Most of these were either providers of one or two ships on a joint service or merely slot charterers therefore doing little to net capacity deployed but the rise in trade exits has intensified this year as more carriers have decided to get out with no prospect of higher freight rates on the horizon The Drewry View The trend towards fewer carriers is not a severe threat to competition Despite prolonged low margins carriers and shipowners have continued to over invest in new ships in order to facilitate international trade all the while giving customers sufficient choice 
Before applying for a loan be it a short term pay day or long term agreement be sure to ask yourself the following five questions Why am I applying for this loan credit facility Applying for a quick little loan to help us in a tight spot doesn t seem so bad Right South African consumers have become far too accustomed with this way of thinking and fail to recognise the implications of living on credit Credit was not designed to replace our salary packages If however you run into a financially straining position such as your car breaking down or an untimely illness credit can alleviate the immediate financial demands Always ensure that the credit you access is used for the right reasons and used responsibly Applying for a loan or retail account to buy a fancy new TV is not a good idea Can I afford the monthly commitments This is a fairly simple question but an honest one If you answer yes with confidence knowing that you have completed your calculations then proceed However if there is small voice within saying no then stop all activity This little voice is the voice of reason the voice of caution and the most realistic self assessment we will ever have If you choose to ignore the warning and throw all caution to the wind you will act recklessly and place yourself in an over indebted position The bottom line is that we are all responsible for the choices we make The time is now to man up to our circumstance and find a viable solution Financial survival mode must be initiated If you are having trouble with repaying your debts seek assistance and help from a professional Have I taken into account all options available to me The most convenient option is not always the most affordable option What would your best alternative to credit be Interesting question in itself don t you think Consumers are obsessed with immediate satisfaction and gratification For example doing some research on fees and charges billed is always a good idea Find packages that are affordable and provide you with peace of mind Alternatively look online for assistance with price checks Buying items second hand can sometimes work out to be more affordable and practical Always get the most out of your deals If you have better or affordable option walk away from your deal Determine what your reservation price is and stick to it How do I avoid the debt trap If you are experiencing some form of financial strain accessing more credit is not going to resolve your underlying problems By accessing debt you are just adding to your worries and stress levels Always make sure that your debt commitments do not exceed of your nett income Be aware of your total debt capital and push your surplus into this balance to bring it down If need be access professional advice and services to help advise and manage your financial plan Create a savings emergency fund to avoid future financial hiccups Will this benefit my credit record Keeping a healthy debt repayment pattern is crucial to your financial health Always make monthly repayments on time and pay the full instalment required Do not over expose your pocket as this can lead to missing payments and falling behind As we mentioned earlier always determine first hand if you can afford the instalments Listen to your better judgment Author Samantha Lotze

SHANGHAI HONG KONG The Di Mei shopping center in downtown Shanghai is a surprisingly depressing place to shop The underground mall is located in one of the most shopping mad cities in China and yet it is run down and starved of customers Sometimes I cannot sell even one dress in a day said dress shop owner Ms Xu who rents a space in Di Mei Rising vacancy rates and plummeting rents are increasingly common in Chinese malls and department stores despite official data showing a sharp rebound in retail sales that helped the world s second largest economy beat expectations in the third quarter The answer to that apparent contradiction lies in the rising competition from online shopping and government purchases possibly boosting retail statistics Add poorly managed properties into the equation and the empty malls aren t much of a surprise More importantly the struggles of Chinese brick and mortar retailers amplify a policy conundrum these malls built to reap gains from rising consumption are instead adding to China s corporate debt problem currently at percent of GDP twice as high as the United States Less foot traffic means cash flow of mall owners and developers are getting squeezed a potential hazard for an economy growing at its slowest pace in decades Di Mei s owners are trying to refurbish but it s unclear whether it will pay off and others are just closing down The Sunlight Store in Beijing for example is located in another prime pedestrian hub but it closed its blinds this month with manager Ni Guifang telling Reuters they are seeking greener pastures online The sales were just OK but the overall sales were on the downward trend Ni said TRIMMING DOWN Major listed mall operators are also feeling the pain Dalian Wanda a big property developer said in January it would close or restructure of its retail venues and in August said more adjustments were underway Malaysia based Parkson HK which operates more than department stores in China closed several of its stores in northern China last year following a percent drop in China net profit in As growth in retail sales slows because of the country s lower GDP growth and in cities where mall space is abundant vacancy rates have risen substantially said Moody s analyst Marie Lam in a research note In its latest efforts to reenergize the economy China s central bank on Friday cut interest rates for the sixth time in less than a year Tim Condon an economist at ING in Singapore warned that investors should not read China s official retail figures as exclusively reflective of rising household consumption noting that the data also capture some government purchases On the other hand e commerce sites continue to post double digit growth rates even as some moderation is evident E commerce leader Alibaba BABA N is expected to report that sales growth slowed sharply in the second quarter albeit to around percent on year still a ripping pace And as more Chinese graduate to the ranks of the middle class places offering entertainment are thriving Movie ticket sales hit a new record of nearly million during a single holiday week in October up percent year on year But this is little consolation for the likes of Di Mei And the risk is that the frenetic pace of mall construction cascades into a bad debt problem for banks if shoppers fail to match the zeal of property developers SHOPPING OVERCAPACITY China is currently the site of more than half the world s shopping mall construction according to CBRE a real estate firm even though it appears that many of these malls will not produce good returns for their investors A joint report by the China Chain Store Association and Deloitte showed that by the end of this year the total number of China s new malls is projected to reach a jump of over percent from Real estate analysts note that much of the surge in retail space construction came at the behest of local governments who were rushing to push real estate development as part of attempts to stimulate the economy The result has been malls built in haste and managed poorly Not surprisingly shoppers are voting with their feet If you build it and they re not coming that s a non performing loan said Condon of ING That s the banks problem Additional reporting by Shao Xiaoyi in BEIJING and the Shanghai Newsroom Editing by Shri Navaratnam

Just after being tear gassed by the Police at the Union Buildings pushing FeesMustFall campaign Then I come back to res and this ignorant kid says education Must be a privilege People must not be lazy They must work hard and get bursaries he said as if they are enough Does he even have an idea of how many people deserve to have got bursaries but couldn t since they are limited Has he ever got an email saying We regret to inform and they will tell you about the number of applications they receive and their limited funds for that particular year I don t think he has ever got such an email Now I have to remind those who are attending or those who attended proper schools where everything is provided some even got the extra classes and extra tutorial classes which is something that doesn t happen to us from rural schools It may seem odd but all those who get above in all their subjects in rural areas are hard workers for the services they have are quite not efficient Another thing the exams are all the same at the end of the year They don t say rural people must write different exam papers because they did not have what those in urban areas have There is nothing wrong with attending a proper school And it s all everybody wishes but what s wrong is the misjudgement Now they get to varsity and they have got money So they attend extra classes for money because let s face it course chows I have also attended a few of those classes they are costly about R per module but worth it So if you don t afford such classes and end up passing with a you are not a hard worker I am talking specifically about Engineering modules maybe if you doing BA we can think otherwise Haha What I could tell from that guy is the fact that he actually doesn t understand the situation He doesn t know what it is to have no computers in your school given an assignment you go to the library and only to find they have no books relating to the subject you are researching or if there is it s one or two A computer cafe at that time costs R per minutes But I m glad there was another guy of the same kind who also tried to tell him about his story and the fact that bursaries are limited And we also can not forget the fact that there is no balance in the way in which bursaries are distributed among courses Engineers are mostly secured than any others What then about those doing BA Are all of them affording to pay by themselves I don t think so We can t be selfish about education and say it should be a privilege unless we redefine the word privilege Now I say that as someone who is from and has worked at an organization that deals with students in rural areas I have seen and understand the situation I believe in working hard but working hard also goes with the aid one gets It is one s responsibility to go extra miles to get the help with his her studies But then you ask yourself one thing How many people offer help for free specifically to those who don t afford paid tutorials I am one of those saying education should be free some research has shown the feasibility It s just that they won t tell you When education is free then they can increase the standards and the criteria in which they select students to study at a tertiary institution That is when we can then say it is a privilege for hard workers but for now it is a privilege for those that can afford When he was about to leave he said You not working hard enough to get a bursary bruh Nx How many extra classes he attends I know of them you will find in those paid extra classes If you don t even have the money to buy food and pay your outstanding tuition fees then where are you gonna get the money to attend extra classes If education could be free then I assume more than of people can then afford to pay for extra classes

Smartphone illustration Israel news photo Flash Speaking before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Monday Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu expressed the need for a smartphone app that Israelis could use to call for help in the case of an emergency Netanyahu said that his office had conducted numerous meetings on how to increase security for Israelis in the wake of the recent terror assault by Arabs around the country In some cases individuals see suspicious people and want to alert someone but are afraid police will not get there in time in other cases they may be witnessing an attack but may be unable to intervene An app Netanyahu said would put people in trouble in touch with others in the area who could help them Netanyahu s perception of the app was that an individual in trouble would press a button describing the problem he or she was facing and others in the area would race to their assistance With an app like this Israelis will be able to summon security forces or rescue agents immediately bringing help to deal with emergencies much more quickly and neutralize terrorists or help victims While there are several apps already on the market that do this Netanyahu sees this as a government project Last year in the wake of the kidnappings and murders of Israeli teens Naftali Frenkel Gilad Sha ar and Eyal Yifrah the government funded an app that hitchhikers could use to indicate that they were in trouble The app sends their location to a server where security personnel are able to follow them and send rescue forces if needed Tags Arab terror in Israel smartphone apps

to every student and eventually make it mandatory Susan Wojcicki is CEO of YouTube She was previously senior vice president of advertising and commerce at Google The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author CNN My daughter was years old when she told me she hated computers As someone who has spent her career helping build one of the largest tech companies in the world I was in shock Suddenly an issue I faced repeatedly at work the lack of women in tech hit squarely at home The story may sound familiar We had one computer at home and in my daughter s words my son had conquered it For good measure she added that it was super lame to like computers and she had better things to do in her busy life Today this same pattern is playing out in homes throughout America Girls are being left out of the conversation when it comes to technology led to think of tech as insular and antisocial without ever being given a chance to correct those perceptions Despite earning the majority of bachelor s degrees women earn only of computer science degrees according to the Computing Research Association These statistics have serious implications for our economy and for women at large By jobs in computer science are expected to grow nearly two times faster than the national average totaling nearly million jobs Yet today women hold only of all tech jobs according to the American Association of University Women Read More The fact that women represent such a small portion of the tech workforce shouldn t just be a wake up call it should be a Sputnik moment The tech industry is not America s future it is our present From manufacturing to health care to agriculture to the arts technology is revolutionizing every industry at an unprecedented pace remaking the world in its wake If women don t participate in tech with its massive prominence in our lives and society we risk losing many of the economic political and social gains we have made over decades We d be setting ourselves back in an era when we should be solidifying and strengthening our progress That s why I was so encouraged to see Mayor Bill de Blasio call for all New York schools to offer computer science courses within the next years Not only will this help the city s students prepare and compete for future jobs it will have an outsize effect on women minorities and the poor who have the least access to computer science education The only way we can address the problem of women in tech while preparing our students for a competitive future is for more states and districts to follow New York City s lead and offer computer science to every student in the United States with the eventual goal of making it mandatory Related Molding the next generation of computer scientists Already some large districts have instituted similar proposals In San Francisco the Board of Education voted to offer CS from prekindergarten through high school and to make it mandatory through eighth grade by the school year And in Chicago the city has pledged to make a yearlong CS course a high school graduation requirement by Other countries are beginning to institute similar standards Last year the United Kingdom became the first country in the European Union to mandate computer science classes for all children between and years old with Italy soon following suit And Israel and South Korea have some of the most rigorous computer science curriculums in the world It s undeniably true that many schools are strapped for resources and consistently face budget challenges But according to research Google commissioned with Gallup nine out of parents see CS as a good use of school resources and two thirds think it should be required learning That view only gets stronger among lower income households If we don t make CS a priority by requiring schools to offer it we risk making gender class and racial gaps worse as income and opportunity flow to students who are given the chance to sit behind a computer My daughter loves computers now I enrolled her in an all girl coding camp where she started to see that technology could make her own world better It s a heartwarming story in my household But unless we act to make sure CS is offered in every school millions of girls throughout America will never have the same opportunity photos Famous women in history The historical analogs

DOE Brookhaven National Laboratory Summary A key arrangement of electrons that may impede superconductivity in cuprates has now been characterized by scientists Understanding this electron density wave may lead to ways to suppress or remove it to induce superconductivity possibly even at room temperature Share Total shares FULL STORY A team led by researchers from the U S Department of Energy s Brookhaven National Laboratory and Cornell University has characterized a key arrangement of electrons in a high temperature superconductor a material that can conduct electricity with almost no energy loss without being ultra chilled The material is a member of a family of copper oxygen based superconducting compounds the cuprates that are prime candidates for numerous potential high impact applications including extremely efficient electricity generation storage and transmission across the nation s power grid The phenomenon they studied is known as an electron density wave Unlike the other electrons in the material which move about freely the density wave is a periodic fixed electron phase that seems to compete with and hinder the superconducting phase Many researchers believe that the density wave is the key to unlocking the cuprates If they can thoroughly understand the electron density wave they say they may be able to determine how to suppress or remove it to induce superconductivity possibly even at room temperature But to achieve this goal they first must gain a thorough understanding of the causes of the electron density wave This study published in the October online edition of Nature Physics is the first to identify the atomic scale origins and influences that produce the density wave in cuprates In a metal you have electrons going in every direction with a wide range of energies and momenta It s almost like a gas of electrons said the study s lead scientist S amus Davis a physicist at Brookhaven and the J G White Distinguished Professor of Physical Sciences at Cornell Which of these electrons provide the components that make up the density wave state in cuprates We were able to answer this question We identified both the energy and momenta of the relevant electrons Another piece of the cuprate puzzle There are several known members of the cuprate family The best one discovered so far works as a superconductor at about Kelvin Celsius roughly halfway between absolute zero C and room temperature C All have layered structures with superconductivity taking place in the crystalline copper oxide CuO layers each just one molecule thick Aside from the superconducting phase these materials exhibit another mysterious form of electronic order dubbed the pseudogap phase While very poorly understood in general its characteristic energy scale called an energy gap is well established Davis group and others have studied this phase extensively Last year along with researchers led by Brookhaven Columbia University School of Engineering physicist Simon Billinge the team established the first firm link between the disappearance of the density wave within the pseudogap phase and the emergence as stated by Davis of universally free flowing electrons needed for unrestricted superconductivity see https www bnl gov newsroom news php a In this most recent work led at Brookhaven by physicist Kazuhiro Fujita the most important result seems to suggest another intimate link between the electron density wave and the pseudogap phase The characteristic energy of the density wave s modulation is equal to the pseudogap energy Moreover they showed that the electrons making up the electron density wave have the characteristic momentum at which the pseudogap appears The fundamental implication is that the pseudogap state is somehow the parent of the density wave state Imaging electrons with electrons The novel experimental approach and the concept of the study itself were conceived after one of the paper s authors Harvard University theoretical physicist Subir Sachdev pondered the differing electron density wave behavior along the different bonds of the CuO unit cell In looking at some of the past data taken by Davis s group I noticed that the electron behavior was unique to the horizontal bonds of the CuO plane he said I wondered if this could be the charge density wave He contacted Davis and they began designing the experiment They proposed a new way to study a cuprate one that no other group had tried a powerful imaging technique developed by Davis called sublattice imaging which is performed using a specialized scanning tunneling microscope STM capable of determining the electronic structure in different subsets of the atoms in the crystal the so called sublattices An STM images a sample using electrons the type used here can see details smaller than the unit cell of the CuO crystal It uses a very sharp metallic tip placed extremely close to the sample surface less than a tenth of a nanometer away A small voltage is then applied across the tip and sample which because of their proximity allows electrons to tunnel through the vacuum gap between the tip and sample The rate of electrons passing through the tip in other words the current is a measure of the density of electrons in the tiny region of the sample directly below it So as the tip is passed across the sample surface it creates a spatial image of the electron density and separately of the crystal lattice DOE Brookhaven National Laboratory Journal Reference M H Hamidian S D Edkins Chung Koo Kim J C Davis A

stores Hide Caption of Story highlights Susan Wojcicki The dearth of women in tech should be a wake up call a Sputnik moment for America She says the United States should offer computer science class to every student and eventually make it mandatory Susan Wojcicki is CEO of YouTube She was previously senior vice president of advertising and commerce at Google The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author CNN My daughter was years old when she told me she hated computers As someone who has spent her career helping build one of the largest tech companies in the world I was in shock Suddenly an issue I faced repeatedly at work the lack of women in tech hit squarely at home The story may sound familiar We had one computer at home and in my daughter s words my son had conquered it For good measure she added that it was super lame to like computers and she had better things to do in her busy life Today this same pattern is playing out in homes throughout America Girls are being left out of the conversation when it comes to technology led to think of tech as insular and antisocial without ever being given a chance to correct those perceptions Despite earning the majority of bachelor s degrees women earn only of computer science degrees according to the Computing Research Association These statistics have serious implications for our economy and for women at large By jobs in computer science are expected to grow nearly two times faster than the national average totaling nearly million jobs Yet today women hold only of all tech jobs according to the American Association of University Women Read More The fact that women represent such a small portion of the tech workforce shouldn t just be a wake up call it should be a Sputnik moment The tech industry is not America s future it is our present From manufacturing to health care to agriculture to the arts technology is revolutionizing every industry at an unprecedented pace remaking the world in its wake If women don t participate in tech with its massive prominence in our lives and society we risk losing many of the economic political and social gains we have made over decades We d be setting ourselves back in an era when we should be solidifying and strengthening our progress That s why I was so encouraged to see Mayor Bill de Blasio call for all New York schools to offer computer science courses within the next years Not only will this help the city s students prepare and compete for future jobs it will have an outsize effect on women minorities and the poor who have the least access to computer science education The only way we can address the problem of women in tech while preparing our students for a competitive future is for more states and districts to follow New York City s lead and offer computer science to every student in the United States with the eventual goal of making it mandatory Related Molding the next generation of computer scientists Already some large districts have instituted similar proposals In San Francisco the Board of Education voted to offer CS from prekindergarten through high school and to make it mandatory through eighth grade by the school year And in Chicago the city has pledged to make a yearlong CS course a high school graduation requirement by Other countries are beginning to institute similar standards Last year the United Kingdom became the first country in the European Union to mandate computer science classes for all children between and years old with Italy soon following suit And Israel and South Korea have some of the most rigorous computer science curriculums in the world It s undeniably true that many schools are strapped for resources and consistently face budget challenges But according to research Google commissioned with Gallup nine out of parents see CS as a good use of school resources and two thirds think it should be required learning That view only gets stronger among lower income households If we don t make CS a priority by requiring schools to offer it we risk making gender class and racial gaps worse as income and opportunity flow to students who are given the chance to sit behind a computer My daughter loves computers now I enrolled her in an all girl coding camp where she started to see that technology could make her own world better It s a heartwarming story in my household But unless we act to make sure CS is offered in every school millions of girls throughout America will never have the same opportunity photos Famous women in history The historical analogs

Study Kids take plus required tests through th grade October by By Jennifer C Kerr In this July file photo students at a summer reading academy at Buchanan elementary school work in the computer lab at the school in Oklahoma City Wading into one of the most polarizing issues in education President Barack Obama called Saturday for capping standardized testing at percent of classroom time while conceding the government shares responsibility for having turned tests into the be all and end all of American schools AP Photo Sue Ogrocki File Students parents and teachers have long lamented the hours that kids spend taking standardized tests especially since the introduction of the Common Core academic standards But just how much time each year A Between hours B Between hours C Between hours The correct answer is B according to a comprehensive study of of the nation s big city school districts by the Council of the Great City Schools It said testing amounts to about percent of classroom time for the average th grader in public school Between pre K and th grade students took about mandatory standardized exams It said testing amounts to percent of classroom time for the average th grader The study analyzed the time spent actually taking the tests but it did not include the hours devoted to preparation ahead of testing required by the federal government states or local districts It also did not include regular day to day classroom quizzes and tests in reading math science foreign languages and more In connection with the study s release Saturday President Barack Obama called for capping standardized testing at percent of classroom time Even while acknowledging that the government shares some responsibility for an over emphasis on testing the president said federal officials would work with states schools and teachers to make sure that we re not obsessing about testing The Obama administration still supports annual standardized tests as a necessary assessment tool and both House and Senate versions of an update to No Child Left Behind law would continue annual testing But the rewrite legislation would let states decide how to use test results to determine what to do with struggling schools Differences between the two bills still need to be worked out Learning is about so much more than just filling in the right bubble Obama said in a video released on Facebook So we re going to work with states school districts teachers and parents to make sure that we re not obsessing about testing To drive the point home Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan scheduled an Oval Office meeting Monday with teachers and school officials working to reduce testing time How much constitutes too much time is really difficult to answer said Michael Casserly the council s executive director He said the study found plenty of redundancy in required testing supporting concerns from teachers and other critics about the tests consuming too much teaching and learning time For example Casserly said that researchers found some states and school districts were mandating not only end of year tests but end of course tests in the same subjects in the same grade Having states and school districts jointly reviewing redundancy and overlap in their testing requirements will be an important step in reducing unnecessary assessments he said The council reviewed testing for more than million students in about three dozen states during the school year And a testing action plan released by the Education Department said too many schools have unnecessary testing Aiming to close achievement gaps and assess learning the No Child Left Behind Act signed by President George W Bush in mandated annual testing in reading and math for students in grades three through eight and again in high school States and local school districts decide which standardized assessments to use to gauge student learning and progress in those two subjects and others This past spring saw the rollout of new tests based on the Common Core college ready academic standards in reading and math About million students in states and the District of Columbia took the tests developed by two groups the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium and the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers PARCC Other findings in the council s report The most tests were required in th and th grade the fewest were in pre K kindergarten and st grade Four in districts report having to wait between two months and four months before getting state test results The lack of timely results means teachers begin a new school year not knowing where a student needs to improve

Ancient wild ox genome reveals complex cow ancestry October The ancestry of domesticated cattle proves more complex than previously thought reports a paper published today in the open access journal Genome Biology The first nuclear genome sequence from an ancient wild ox reveals that some modern domestic cow breeds including the Scottish Highland and Irish Kerry had wild ancestors that were British as well as Asian The aurochs Bos primigenius is an extinct wild ox species that ranged across the grasslands of Eurasia and North Africa years ago Domestication of aurochs gave rise to two major groups of cattle Bos taurus and Bos indicus Previous studies have shown that European B taurus are descended from western Asian populations of aurochs However little was known about the relationship between domesticated cattle and wild aurochs in Europe and how wild populations contributed to the evolutionary history of the cows that graze our fields today To build a clearer picture of the ancestry of European cattle breeds scientists from University College Dublin extracted genetic material from a bone of a year old wild British aurochs discovered in a cave in Derbyshire England They then sequenced its complete genome its genetic blueprint and compared it with the genomes of domesticated B taurus and B indicus animals and DNA marker information from more than modern cows The team of researchers discovered clear evidence of breeding between wild British aurochs and early domesticated cattle David MacHugh senior author on the study from the School of Agriculture and Food Science at University College Dublin said Our results show the ancestors of modern British and Irish breeds share more genetic similarities with this ancient specimen than other European cattle This suggests that early British farmers may have restocked their domesticated herds with wild aurochs Genes linked to neurobiology and muscle development were also found to be associated with domestication of the ancestors of European cattle indicating that a key part of the domestication process was the selection of cattle based on behavioural and meat traits David MacHugh added This is the first complete nuclear genome sequence from the extinct Eurasian aurochs Our new study contradicts earlier simple models of cattle domestication and evolution that we and others proposed based on mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosomes What now emerges from high resolution studies of the nuclear genome is a more nuanced picture of crossbreeding and gene flow between domestic cattle and wild aurochs as early European farmers moved into new habitats such as Britain during the Neolithic

New tech automatically tunes powered prosthetics while walking Posted Today When amputees receive powered prosthetic legs the power of the prosthetic limbs needs to be tuned by a prosthetics expert so that a patient can move normally but the prosthetic often needs repeated re tuning Biomedical engineering researchers at North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have now developed software that allows powered prosthetics to tune themselves automatically making the devices more functionally useful and lowering the costs associated with powered prosthetic use When a patient gets a powered prosthetic it needs to be customized to account for each individual patient s physical condition because people are different in size and strength And that tuning is done by a prosthetist says Helen Huang lead author of a paper on the work and an associate professor in the biomedical engineering program at NC State and UNC Chapel Hill In addition people are dynamic a patient s physical condition may change as he or she becomes accustomed to a prosthetic leg for example or they may gain weight These changes mean the prosthetic needs to be re tuned and working with a prosthetist takes time and money To address this problem the researchers developed an algorithm that can be incorporated into the software of any powered prosthesis to automatically tune the amount of power a prosthetic limb needs in order for a patient to walk comfortably The algorithm would not only make it easier for patients to walk while reducing prosthetist related costs but would also allow a prosthesis to adjust to changing conditions Video of the technology in action can be seen here For example the algorithm could provide more power to a prosthesis when a patient carries a heavy suitcase through an airport Huang says The system works by taking into account the angle of the prosthetic knee while walking Powered prosthetic legs are programmed so that the angle of the prosthetic joints the knee or ankle while walking mimics the normal movement of the joints when an able bodied person is walking During the conventional prosthetic tuning process a prosthetist adjusts the powered prosthesis s system so that it exerts the power necessary to recreate those normal joint motions while walking But changes in a person s weight or gait can affect the prosthesis s ability to achieve that natural joint angle The automatic tuning algorithm takes a similar approach tracking the angle of the prosthetic joint while walking But it is able to adjust the amount of power the prosthesis receives in real time in order to maintain the proper angle In testing we found that the computer using the algorithm performed better than prosthetists at achieving the proper joint angle Huang says So we know our approach works But we re still working to make it better Prosthetists rely on years of experience to not only adjust the joint angle but to adjust a prosthesis to help patients maintain a comfortable posture while walking Huang adds We re not yet able to replicate the prosthetist s success in achieving those comfortable trunk motions but it s something we re working on

Aesop would have had a straightforward explanation for why some people just can t manage to save up for retirement Some people are born ants industrious and in possession of great willpower while others are grasshoppers living only for today Millennia later sorting workers into personality specific boxes is still the preferred way of thinking about how to get people to put more money into savings An otherwise thoughtful survey of over individuals and interviews with people by the MetLife Mature Markets Institute identifies no fewer than different variations on the grasshopper There are Snoozers Oversleepers Stewers Brewers And then there are Preemptive Planners whose radar screens are populated with future risks If people fit into these neat buckets the conventional savings wisdom goes then the solution is to educate the grasshoppers to start behaving more like ants MetLife isn t wrong to dwell on personality types Researchers such as Angela Duckworth a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania have found convincing links between personality traits and savings Duckworth doesn t talk about oversleepers but about the Big Five personality traits conscientiousness agreeableness neuroticism openness and extroversion Conscientious types she s found tend to save more money 
Share Oracle s Larry Ellison took the stage Sunday night to open his company s massive tech conference in San Francisco As expected he talked about cloud computing and more cloud computing Oracle like all the classic IT vendors is madly racing after cloud computing because business customers are going gaga for it ditching their traditional way of buying software and hardware and renting it from companies like Amazon Web Services and Google instead Ellison noted that the cloud computing marketing is actually years old founded by NetSuite and Salesforce com both companies he helped found and it s hitting a growth phase But it s still pretty young The biggest cloud companies are billion in terms of their cloud business he pointed out as opposed to billion to billion the size of today s biggest tech companies For instance AWS has brought in billion in the first three quarters of dropping billion of profits to the bottom line But revenue size doesn t matter because the cloud is already changing the tech landscape he says About percent of Oracle s customers are buying tech via the cloud instead of the traditional way he said That s going to grow exponentially in the years to come But when Oracle competes for a cloud contract at a customer he says he sees Amazon all the time Microsoft frequently and Google sometimes But not IBM or SAP Our two biggest competitors that we watched most closely over last two decades IBM and SAP and we no longer pay any attention to either one of them It is quite a shock Ellison says I can make the case that IBM was greatest company in the history of companies but they are just nowhere in the cloud SAP is the largest applications company that ever existed They are nowhere in the cloud he added Both SAP and IBM would argue with Ellison s perception Both of them claim their cloud businesses are doing well and growing rapidly Still Ellison insists that Oracle is mostly competing with Salesforce com and Workday He also applauded his historic competitor Microsoft for having game in the cloud Of its traditional competitors Microsoft is the only one that has crossed the chasm and is now competing aggressively in all three levels of cloud Those levels involve renting hardware renting software applications and renting application programming services Naturally he also offered a report card in which he showed off how many customers Oracle has gained in the part of the cloud where it is doing best renting applications known as Software as a Service or SaaS He claims that Oracle is besting Workday and is a close second to Salesforce in terms of the numbers of customers Keep in mind when looking at these numbers that across all of Oracle s massive number of products it has about customers marketing chief Judith Sims told the audience Oracle CTO Larry Ellison shows off how many SaaS customers Oracle has

As the U S prepares to resettle at least Syrian refugees next year Stratus Video Interpreting identifies cities states where healthcare facilities are likely to see an increase in Arabic speaking limited English proficient LEP patients Clearwater FL PRWEB October Secretary of State John Kerry recently announced the government will increase its cap on the total number of refugees admitted to the United States raising it to in and in with at least displaced Syrians to be taken in over next year and resettled in one of designated host cities nationwide Stratus Video Interpreting a leading provider of on demand interpretation services identifies the states and metropolitan areas where Syrian refugees are likely to be resettled and advises healthcare providers in those locations to prepare for a rise in limited English proficient LEP patients requiring Arabic interpretation services Millions of Syrians have fled from Bashar al Assad s regime and Islamic State forces leading to what has been dubbed the world s largest humanitarian crisis since World War II Since more than million Syrians have been internally displaced and nearly million have left the country and registered as refugees Nearly refugees have applied for asylum in Europe and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR has already referred for resettlement in the United States with priority given to vulnerable individuals such as widowed women unaccompanied children and those with life threatening medical conditions During fiscal year which ended on September a total of Syrians were admitted the United States Nearly three quarters of them were resettled among ten states in Texas in California in Michigan in Illinois in Arizona in Pennsylvania in Florida in New Jersey in Massachusetts and in Kentucky Many of these states are already home to large Syrian born populations as of the top metropolitan areas for Syrian natives were Los Angeles New York Chicago Riverside Calif Detroit Phoenix Allentown Pa Boston Miami and Atlanta When Syrian refugees begin arriving in larger numbers next year they re likely to be resettled in areas with established Syrian communities noted David Fetterolf President of Stratus Video Interpreting Many of these new arrivals including children torture victims and those with serious health conditions will need immediate medical care and government regulations require that patients with limited English proficiency have access to qualified healthcare interpretation services By examining current resettlement and residency patterns we can predict areas that will likely experience an increased demand for medical interpreters Fetterolf says healthcare providers in the above mentioned cities and states would be wise to prepare for an influx of

The Chinese are coming and they are setting their sights on cricket in South Asia After Pepsico Inc broke off its billion rupee million sponsorship deal with the glitzy Indian Premier League ten days ago a Chinese smartphone maker is stepping in to gain from cricket s almost religion like status in a region of billion people Vivo Mobile India Pvt a unit of Guangdong BBK Electronics Industry Co replaced Pepsico as the title sponsor undeterred by the fading popularity of the tournament which has lately been plagued by many scandals While Vivo has surprised most Indians who have never heard of it the cricket contract may just be what the Chinese company needs scandals notwithstanding to expand its reach in one of the world s fastest growing smartphone markets India s smartphone market is likely to overtake the U S to be the second biggest in the world by according to International Data Corp Vivo which made its mark in China with smartly designed phones that sell for less than will mainly compete with local handset makers Micromax Informatics Ltd and Intex Technologies India Pvt and other Chinese manufacturers Neil Shah research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research in Mumbai said India is a huge opportunity for everyone and whoever keeps investing now will recoup the rewards later Shah said in an interview Just look at Samsung and Micromax they invested hugely in setting up a network and are No and for quite some time now China Rivals Vivo has a history of rapidly grabbing market share from established rivals In its highly competitive home market the company rose to the fourth place ahead of Samsung Electronics Corp with a percent share of the Chinese market from an th place less than two years ago according to Counterpoint India s smartphone market can be divided into three categories with different companies dominating each band Local handset makers Micromax Intex and Karbonn Mobiles India Ltd dominate the sub category whereas Chinese manufacturers Xiaomi Corp and Lenovo Group Ltd are known for their models that range between and Shah said Samsung is the biggest seller of the higher end phones up to Vivo has eight models currently selling in India that range from to though if it s China business were an indication then most of the sales focus will be on the cheapest models Short Form Cricket They develop the high end models and advertise it extensively but their volumes come from the cheaper models Kiranjeet Kaur a senior analyst at International Data Corp said in an interview They ll probably take the same approach in India But the path in India will take a long time The company s market share was percent in the quarter ended June according to Counterpoint data That compares with market leaders Samsung and Micromax which control about percent and percent respectively The IPL where eight teams compete in the Twenty short format version of cricket started in when the Board of Control for Cricket in India auctioned off the league s clubs to investors including billionaire Mukesh Ambani chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd and movie star Shah Rukh Khan The rapid fire appeal of a Twenty match has led to high scoring games with more risk taking by the batsmen attracting viewers who otherwise don t have the time to watch the game s classic format five day test matches or a one day face off that is typically played for about six hours not including lunch and refreshments Match Fixing Allegations However the league s reputation has been tainted by allegations of illegal betting and match fixing The biggest scandal in the IPL came to the forefront in when several players and team officials were arrested on charges of placing bets on matches a practice that s illegal in India Earlier this year the Board of Control for Cricket in India suspended two teams the Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals for two years Chennai s team was among the league s most decorated and headed by Indian national team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Reports of Pepsico s termination of the title sponsorship deal were doing the rounds in the local media for two weeks Then on Oct the cricket board said that Vivo had been appointed as the title sponsor for two years Pepsico India spokesman Pradeep Wadhwa declined to comment Falling Allure Partly because of these scandals and also because of a plethora of cricket on television the allure of the sport for audiences has fallen This has made the return from IPL sponsorships somewhat unpredictable giving pause to consumer goods conglomerates and other established companies that ve formed the bulk of cricket related advertising in India said Ajimon Francis head of India operations at consultancy Brand Finance Plc The traditional sponsors would be a little more watchful due to the topsy turvy nature of the tournament Francis said via phone Internet enabled companies are the new wave of sponsors coming in However by putting its name on a popular cricket series that is viewed on television by millions of Indians Vivo will be able to quickly engender widespread brand awareness Counterpoint s Shah said The scandals may not have a sizable impact on the company s prospects Getting the sponsorship is a really good win for them Shah said Rural people may not have G and G connections but they do have a TV

Brian M Culley Chief Executive Officer About the Phase Chronic Heart Failure Study The Phase study is http feeds bio medicine org latest medical technology Date SAN DIEGO Oct PRNewswire Mast Therapeutics Inc NYSE MKT MSTX a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its molecular adhesion and sealant technology MAST platform to develop novel therapies for sickle cell disease heart failure and stroke announced that it has initiated its Phase study of vepoloxamer for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure Dr Edwin L Parsley Chief Medical Officer of the Company said Previously announced positive results from multiple randomized placebo controlled studies of vepoloxamer in a well established model of chronic heart failure including a repeat treatment study as well as recommendations from medical experts in the field strongly support clinical development of vepoloxamer in this setting If the promising results observed in non clinical studies translate to patients with chronic heart failure vepoloxamer may offer a novel way of directly improving left ventricle contractile function by restoring cardiomyocyte membrane integrity and increasing cardiomyocyte survival Significantly in this Phase study vepoloxamer will be administered over hours in an outpatient setting as opposed to the hour administration in our sickle cell disease studies which will help demonstrate its practical utility for chronic heart failure patients We intend to collect echocardiographic data on parameters such as ejection fraction as well as biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes such as ultra high sensitivity troponin I and NT proBNP as these metrics were improved in a statistically significantly manner in previously announced heart failure models Brian M Culley Chief Executive Officer of the Company added We are pleased to have initiated this patient Phase study which notably is testing a new formulation of vepoloxamer We designed the new formulation to be more suitable for heart failure patients and have filed a provisional patent application We now have multiple pending patent applications including a new formulation application and a new composition of matter application which would provide market protection for vepoloxamer in the setting of heart failure In addition the new formulation is distinct from our sickle cell formulation which may provide important commercial advantages About the Phase Chronic Heart Failure StudyThe Phase study is a randomized double blind placebo controlled multicenter study both within and outside the U S of a new formulation of vepoloxamer in ambulatory patients ages to diagnosed with chronic heart failure New York Heart Association functional Class II or III who are stable and well managed on an established guideline based medication regimen for at least four weeks have a documented left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF as the most recent value within the last months and have an elevated cardiac troponin I cTnI blood level Approximately patients will be randomized into one of three approximately patient study arms and receive one of two dose levels of vepoloxamer or the placebo control administered in addition to standard medical therapy as a single intravenous infusion over three hours in an outpatient setting or short stay inpatient unit depending on local practice and resource availability The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate whether vepoloxamer can provide both a functional and biochemical benefit to damaged heart muscle cells which will be evaluated by measurement of echocardiograms and blood based laboratory markers and to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of vepoloxamer in chronic heart failure patients compared to placebo control About Mast Therapeutics Mast Therapeutics Inc is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Diego California The Company is leveraging its MAST platform derived from over

Exploring the seas thanks to space October Eurobot is prepared for the Neutral Buoyancy Facility at the European Astronaut Centre EAC in Cologne Germany Credit ESA S Koenen An underwater robot initially built to help astronauts train for life in weightlessness is now being tested in the Mediterranean Sea One day robots like this may carry out sophisticated missions on our ocean floors from finding lost aircraft blackboxes to mining minerals or maintaining the sites of ancient pirate shipwrecks In space stations robots are playing an increasingly important role These days if an astronaut needs to carry out a minor fix it might well be that a mechanical arm hands them their tools But human robot teamwork in weightlessness can be tricky If the astronaut is unused to working with a mechanical arm the tool might go floating off So when ESA decided to build a robot assistant they wanted a way for astronauts to practise grasping tools proffered in space before ever leaving Earth Working with Italy s Thales Alenia Space ESA built a replica the Eurobot Wet Model and put it in a swimming pool for astronauts gain experience with the robot in weightlessness With experience developing robotic manipulators Italian company Graal Tech came onboard to help Their robot has three limbs each of which does double duty as a walking leg or a grasping arm Next they covered the robot with floatation devices We had to add a lot of fat to each single arm said Graal Tech s Alessio Turetta In the end it looked like the Michelin Man While this created a robot with neutral buoyancy in each and every part it was too fat and difficult to manoeuvre It s just like an overweight person said Alessio One leg rubbed against the other To solve this the team tinkered with its movement pattern They introduced a crab walk that gave the limbs all the room they needed It worked Graal Tech s robot has been used ever since by astronauts practising in the pool at ESA s European Astronaut Centre in Cologne Germany This video is not supported by your browser at this time Two Maris underwater robot handling an object underwater each one with one of Graal Tech s astronaut arms From space to under the sea Working in space led the companyto take to the seas After the ESA project ended in Graal Tech capitalised on the underwater expertise Most existing underwater robots on the market are hydraulic While they offer strength they have relatively little fine control Graal Tech s is electric powered however capable of both fine movement and targeted actions We realised that our ESA astronaut robot technology was good enough to commercialise said Alessio With the help of European Commission funding they did just that One of the first requests came from Giuseppe Casalino robotics professor at the University of Genoa in Italy He wanted to prototype a robot that might one day scour the ocean s floor for archaeological itemsor even a blackbox from a lost aircraft He liked the electrical arms developed for the Eurobot Wet Model because of their ability to perform precise tasks without compromising too much on strength Strong but blunt hydraulic lifts exist for heavy duty operations explained Giuseppe There is also equipment out there for biologists and archaeologists who need very fine work We believed something in between should be developed As part of three EC funded projects Graal Tech began working with Giuseppe and his team This video is not supported by your browser at this time Graal Tech s astronaut arm mounted on an underwater vehicle and successfully recovering an item on the seafloor Credit Genoa Robotics and Automation Laboratory University of Genova Attaching a Graal Tech astronaut arm to an underwater vehicle the first goal was to create a system that could work autonomously underwater on different grasping tasks This was tested successfully at depths of m in the Mediterranean Sea near the Balearic Islands Now the Italian Maris national project is testing two separate vehicles each equipped with one of the special arms They grasp large objects manipulate them and carry them from one place to another underwater An imminent oil and gas project will be equipped with one or two arms Commercial applications are foreseen continues Giuseppe The oil and gas industry need this to cut costs Tests will be carried out in the North Sea or the Mediterranean some m deep within a year Eurobot could play an important role in EVA support on the International Space Station Here the Eurobot Web Model hands a tool to an astronaut

mining is a very promising field which is expected to grow in the near future Giuseppe adds Noting that working underwater poses challenges similar to those encountered in space Alessio and Giuseppe both believe that underwater robots might one day be used for many dangerous tasks currently performed by human divers such as maintaining offshore plants and inspecting ocean pipes For Graal Tech these developments are very welcome Alessio credits ESA with having played a central role in the creation of their underwater arm We can say our experience with ESA was the start of it all Without the

A hot new development for ultracold magnetic sensors by Staff Writers Washington DC SPX Oct This image shows an optical micro picture of a small part of a series SQUID array showing SQUIDs and a high resolution picture showing only SQUIDs The array is fabricated by optical lithography after depositing a YBa Cu O thin film on a SrTiO bicrystal Each SQUID consists of two Josephson junctions connected in parallel The Josephson junctions schematically represented as red crosses can be seen as micron wide narrow bridges crossing the bicrystal boundary shown with a dotted line Each pair of successive SQUIDs is connected in series via inductive large area narrow flux focusers one is highlighted with a red U shape The flux inside each SQUID hole is quantized Flux coherency in the array is reached when each SQUID hole is penetrated by the same number of integers of flux quanta Image courtesy Boris Chesca and Loughborough University For a larger version of this image please go here Magnetoencephalography or MEG is a non invasive technique for investigating human brain activity for surgical planning or research and has been used in hospitals and universities for more than years It s just one of the many powerful technologies made possible by a tiny device called a SQUID short for superconducting quantum interference device SQUIDs can detect minuscule magnetic fields useful in applications ranging from medical imaging of soft tissue to oil prospecting The most sensitive commercial magnetic sensors require a single SQUID kept at Kelvin an incredibly chilly temperature that is usually maintained with expensive and difficult to handle liquid helium Now researchers from Loughborough University and Nottingham University both in the United Kingdom have built a multi SQUID device that can operate at K the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen a much cheaper coolant The new device still outperforms most standard K SQUID magnetometers The team reports their results this week in the journal Applied Physics Letters from AIP Publishing We believe there should be an immediate interest in the entire SQUID community for the potential replacement of their existing superconducting magnetic sensors based on single SQUIDs operating at K with our SQUID arrays operating at K said Boris Chesca a physicist at Loughborough University and first author on the new paper Chesca and his colleagues achieved their breakthrough high temperature SQUID performance by taking advantage of strength in numbers While low temperature SQUIDs are inherently more sensitive a large array of high temperature SQUIDs could theoretically achieve the same performance as a single low temperature one SQUIDs work by converting a measure of magnetic intensity called flux into a voltage If you string together a series of SQUIDs the voltage output scales in direct proportion to the number of SQUIDs while the noise in the measurement only increases as a square root of the SQUID count Therefore the more SQUIDs you have the stronger the signal and the more sensitive the measurement that can be performed The catch is that the approach only works if all the SQUIDs experience the same magnetic flux a condition called flux coherency and the interaction between each SQUID and its neighbors is minimized both tricky conditions to meet because of parasitic fluxes that form during normal SQUID operation Flux coherency could never be reached in the previous approaches in large SQUID arrays with more than SQUIDs Chesca noted The key difference in the array that Chesca and his colleagues designed has to do with a feature called a flux focuser Flux focusers are large areas of superconductor that improve magnetic field sensitivity and minimize parasitic fluxes In previous SQUID arrays there were either no flux focusers or the flux focusers were so large that they limited the number of SQUIDs that could be integrated onto a single chip In the new design the flux focusers are narrow but long By keeping the width of the focusers identical to the SQUIDs width the researchers could easily string together an arbitrarily long series of SQUIDs while still achieving a high degree of flux coherence and field sensitivity by increasing the length of the flux focusers Chesca and his colleagues tested the performance of their arrays one SQUIDs long and the other SQUIDs long and compared them to the performance of optimized low temperature single SQUIDs operating at K generally the gold standard for industrial magnetometers They found that the new arrays white flux noise a key performance parameter linked to sensitivity were superior to those of the K SQUIDs Since our SQUID arrays operate at K using liquid nitrogen they provide a magnetic sensor that is very cost effective considering that operation of SQUIDs at K requires the use of liquid helium which is much more expensive and also requires extensive training for its handling Chesca said He also noted that the price of helium which is a common isotope of helium is rapidly increasing and its availability may soon be limited to conserve strategic supplies Liquid nitrogen on the other hand is much more readily available and is already used on a daily basis in colleges and universities around the world Chesca and his colleagues are currently working on optimizing the shape and design of the SQUID arrays to maximize their magnetic field sensitivity The most exciting aspect of our result is that replacing single SQUIDs operating at K with SQUID arrays operating at K would be for the first time not only a cheaper and more user friendly solution but a solution that comes with no compromise regarding noise resolution Chesca said The article Flux coherent series SQUID array magnetometers operating above K with superior white flux noise than single SQUIDs at K is authored by Boris Chesca Daniel John and Christopher J Mellor It will be published in the journal Applied Physics Letters on October DOI

Screen of human genome reveals set of genes essential for cellular viability October This image shows the coding region in a segment of eukaryotic DNA Credit National Human Genome Research Institute Using two complementary analytical approaches scientists at Whitehead Institute and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard have for the first time identified the universe of genes in the human genome essential for the survival and proliferation of human cell lines or cultured human cells Their findings and the materials they developed in conducting the research will not only serve as invaluable resources for the global research community but should also have application in the discovery of drug targetable genetic vulnerabilities in a variety of human cancers Scientists have long known the essential genes in microorganisms such as yeast whose genomes are smaller and more easily manipulated Most common yeast strains for example are haploid meaning that genes exist in single copies making it fairly simple for researchers to eliminate or knock out individual genes and assess the impact on the organism However owing to their greater complexity diploid mammalian genomes including the human genome have been resistant to such knockout techniques including RNA interference which is hampered by off target effects and incomplete gene silencing Now however through use of the breakthrough CRISPR for clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats genome editing system researchers in the labs of Whitehead Member David Sabatini and Broad Institute Director Eric Lander have been able to generate a genome wide library of single guide RNAs sgRNAs to screen for and identify the genes required for cellular viability The sgRNA library targeted slightly more than genes of which approximately proved to be essential These findings are reported online this week in the journal Science This is the first report of human cell essential genes says Tim Wang a graduate student in the Sabatini and Lander labs and first author of the Science paper This answers a question people have been asking for quite a long time As might have been expected Wang says that many of the essential genes are involved in fundamental biological processes including DNA replication RNA transcription and translation of messenger RNA But as Wang also notes approximately of these essential genes are of a class not previously characterized are largely located in the cellular compartment known as the nucleolus and are associated with RNA processing Wang says the precise function of these genes is the subject of future investigation To validate the results of the CRISPR screens the group took the added step of screening for essential genes in a unique line of haploid human cells Using an approach known as gene trap mutagenesis a method pioneered in part by former Whitehead Fellow Thijn Brummelkamp in the haploid cells and comparing it to the CRISPR results the researchers found significant consistent overlap in the gene sets found to be essential In a final step the group tested their approaches in cell lines derived from two cancers chronic myelogenous leukemia CML and Burkitt s lymphoma both of which have been extensively studied The novel method not only identified the essentiality of the known genes in the case of CML it hit on the BCR and ABL genes whose translocation is the target of the successful drug Gleevec but also highlighted additional genes that may be therapeutic targets in these cancers The ability to zero in on the essential genes in the highly complex human system will give us new insight into how diseases such as cancer continue to resist efforts to defeat them Lander says Wang Lander and Sabatini are enthusiastic about the potential applications of their work as it should accelerate the identification of cancer drug targets while enhancing our understanding of the evolution of drug resistance a major contributor to therapeutic failure The researchers attribute this vast potential to the rigor that CRISPR brings to human genetics This is really the first time we can reliably accurately and systematically study genetics in mammalian cells Sabatini says It s remarkable how well it s working This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grant CA the National Human Genome Research Institute grant U HG the National Science Foundation the MIT Whitaker Health Sciences Fund and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute David Sabatini s primary affiliation is with Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research where his laboratory is located and all his research is conducted He is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and a professor of biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
X ray study reveals new details of how burrowing sea creatures shape geology October This marine worm commonly known as a ragworm can grow up to inches in length It is part of a class of worms known as polychaetes A tiny variety of polychaetes perhaps a millimeter in length may have been responsible for creating burrows that were studied in million year old fossil samples at SLAC s Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource The fossil study explored the chemical traces associated with the ancient burrows Credit Wikimedia Commons Research at the Department of Energy s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory reveals new details about how tiny burrowing sea organisms can influence the chemistry and structure of rocks where hydrocarbon deposits such as oil and gas are found An international team of scientists used X rays to image the chemistry of rock samples containing well preserved million year old fossilized burrows which may have been made by millimeter sized bristly worms known as polychaetes They found that the worms appeared to concentrate some chemical elements in their burrows while depleting others The study published online Oct in the journal Geology provides new insight into how ancient sea worms interact with the sediment on the ocean bottom and control the composition and geochemical signature of rocks formed by that sediment which today serve as markers for ancient climate patterns and oil and gas reservoirs The pioneering X ray scanning method that researchers used at SLAC opens up new ways to study Earth s distant environmental and geological past and supports research about the formation of hydrocarbon deposits While it s only in its early stages the research shows a lot of promise said Dario Harazim a petroleum geologist who led the study while working as instructor at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada We might need to rethink the processes of how certain elements are incorporated into the rock record how they are preserved and how we use them to reconstruct the chemistry and other properties of the ancient ocean Harazim said To date the ancient ocean temperatures oxygen levels and other factors important in rock formation have been considered major drivers controlling the accumulation of trace elements in the rock he said Here we provide new insight into how burrowing organisms play a major role in controlling the trace amounts of some elements in rocks formed from sediment While the sea worms like the ones that likely made these ancient burrows are still important in the modern environment they are difficult to observe because they are embedded in the sticky mud of the sea floor Removing worms and their surrounding mud to a more convenient location for study would disrupt their relationship with their natural environment and might not yield trustworthy results From Dino Birds to Burrowing Worms Using a rapid X ray scanning technique developed for fossil studies at SLAC s Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource researchers studied the detailed chemistry of fossilized burrows likely produced by sea worms million years ago These images show a black and white photograph of a cross section of a fossil sample left a false color scan of the sample s iron content middle with iron concentrations shown in lighter shades and a false color scan of the phosphorous content right with phosphorous concentrations shown in lighter shades Credit D Harazim et al Geology Harazim partnered with a research group based at University of Manchester to study exceptionally preserved rock samples from Baja California in Mexico The Manchester group had worked with SLAC distinguished staff scientist Uwe Bergmann to develop a fast X ray scanning technique for studying fossils at SLAC s Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource SSRL a DOE Office of Science User Facility The technique has been used to study chemical traces of feathers and tissues in a famous fossil link between birds and dinosaurs Unlike many conventional techniques the unique fast scanning technique at SSRL is non destructive so it preserved the features and localized chemistry of the worm burrows It can also image large sample surfaces of up to tens of square centimeters The large scale imaging capabilities at SSRL permitted the precise mapping of very small chemical concentrations associated with these organisms interaction with their environment said Phillip Manning a University of Manchester paleontologist who helped to pioneer the technique This latest collaboration between accelerator physics and paleontology has once again resurrected chemical ghosts that shed new light on key scientific questions The study shows how a unique and sophisticated feeding strategy allows the sea worms to separate sediment particles of different sizes Harazim said They consume mineral particles clay and bacteria that live on the mineral surfaces As this mix passes through their chemically aggressive gut this material is getting broken down and degraded The way the worms redistribute and digest these grains and how they control the concentration of some elements is still not well understood Their feeding creates pockets of porous sediment that can potentially fill over time with concentrations of mineral cement organic material and potentially even hydrocarbons The researchers who verified the SSRL results with those obtained from other conventional methods found that certain elements including strontium and barium are depleted from all areas of the rock These elements were likely either being absorbed into the worms bodies or released to the surrounding waters Applications in Ancient Climate Ocean Chemistry Studies Further research may lead to a better understanding of how analyzing the chemical signature of these burrowing organisms may relate to ancient climate patterns and changes in ocean chemistry Harazim said This technique allows you to study how the activity of burrowing organisms can influence the chemistry and composition of the rock they are living in It helps us to better understand the geological record and helps us to read Earth s geological past in a more sophisticated way he said He said there are plans for follow up research with different types of fossilized samples to see if there are commonalities in their chemical concentration and distribution There is still a lot to learn about how these organisms impact the porosity and geochemical composition of rocks and how loose sediment becomes rock he said

Rare earths advance search for unified theory October Each of the National Ignition Facility s beamlines contains two large amplifier sections The amplifiers are designed to efficiently provide percent of NIF s power and energy Laser amplifier glass is doped with rare earth ions which new research shows prevent external heat and noise from affecting the laser transitions Rare earth elements are used in computer hard drives electric motors and to generate and amplify the lasers at Lawrence Livermore s National Ignition Facility NIF Future applications may include serving as memory for a quantum computer or the basis for ultrastable clocks In recent work by LLNL scientist Michael Hohensee and colleagues the team shows that the properties that make rare earth elements so useful also make them great probes of physics beyond the Standard Model The Standard Model of particle physics is a theory concerning the electromagnetic weak and strong nuclear interactions as well as classifying all the subatomic particles known The rare earths comprise elements in the periodic table scandium yttrium and the lanthanides lanthanum cerium praseodymium neodymium promethium samarium europium gadolinium terbium dysprosium holmium erbium thulium ytterbium and lutetium Despite their name the rare earths with the exception of promethium are not all that rare but are found in relatively high concentrations across the globe However because of their geochemical properties they seldom occur in easily exploitable deposits Rare earth elements are essential for American competitiveness in the clean energy industry because they are used in many devices important to a high tech economy and national security including computer components high power magnets wind turbines mobile phones solar panels superconductors hybrid electric vehicle batteries LCD screens night vision goggles tunable microwave resonators and at the Laboratory NIF s neodymium glass laser amplifiers According to Hohensee rare earths make great magnets in part because their valence electrons have more orbital angular momentum than other elements and because other electrons form a shield around the valence electrons This shield also helps make them good laser media as it prevents external heat and noise from affecting the laser transitions maintaining the rare earths unique properties when they are mixed or doped into a piece of glass or crystal Thanks to both these properties the electronic states of rare earths doped in a crystal make possible an electronic equivalent of the Michelson Morley experiment that would be more sensitive than any other yet performed helping to validate or rule out unified theories of gravity and particle physics Hohensee said The Michelson Morley experiment forms one of the fundamental tests of special relativity theory Other collaborators include researchers from the School of Physics at the University of New South Wales in Australia The research will appear in a future edition of Physical Review Letters A Shift to green energy sources could mean crunch in supply of scarce metals March A large scale shift from coal fired electric power plants and gasoline fueled cars to wind turbines and electric vehicles could increase demand for two already scarce metals available almost exclusively in China The future of sustainable energy is in the exploitation of rare earths May A recent technological and energy revolution has given rare earths strong importance due to their electric magnetic and electronic properties A group of researchers from the Institute of Physical Sciences at the Autonomous Simple separation process for neodymium and dysprosium June Rare earth metals are critical components of electronic materials and permanent magnets Recycling of consumer products is a promising source for these rare commodities In the journal Angewandte Chemie American scientists Critical Materials Institute rare earth recycling

Tesla Autopilot software will let some cars drive park and change lanes by themselves It should not hit pedestrians hopefully says Tesla CEO Elon Musk The Associated Press Posted Oct AM ET Last Updated Oct PM ET WATCH Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the autopilot function Related Stories Why luxury automakers are rushing to make electric cars Electric car maker Tesla Motors is leapfrogging competitors with a new autopilot system that lets cars change lanes by themselves Like other semi autonomous systems already available from Mercedes Audi and Volvo Tesla s system automatically keeps the car within its lane and maintains a certain distance from the car in front both at highway speeds and on city streets It can find a parking spot and parallel park itself It also uses cameras and sensors to warn drivers about potential side impacts But analysts say the lane changing feature is an industry first Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the system is also unique because it will constantly collect data from actual drivers and improve itself The system will note for example how quickly drivers can safely navigate a particular bend in the road or where stop signs are located Why luxury automakers are rushing to make electric cars I think this is going to be quite a profound experience for people Musk said Wednesday in a conference call with media It will change people s perception of the future quite drastically Musk also added a word of caution Drivers need to keep their hands on the wheel and the autopilot system will chime to remind them if they don t Drivers not Tesla will be held liable if there s a crash Musk said It should not hit pedestrians hopefully Musk added It should handle them well We re being especially cautious at this early stage so we re advising drivers to keep their hands on the wheel just in case he said The software is very new Delivered via software update Musk said fully autonomous hands free driving is still at least three years away from a technical standpoint although it will probably take regulators longer than that to allow it Jalopnik s Michael Ballaban posted a video of himself driving a Model S with Autopilot enabled gasping nervously as the car changed lanes and maintained a safe distance behind other vehicles on its own The autopilot update will be added to around vehicles worldwide including Model S sedans made after September and Model X SUVs Owners will get the system through a software update starting Wednesday evening in North America Owners in Europe and Asia will get the software update in about a week People with Model S sedans that were made earlier don t have the required sensors and won t be able to add them retroactively Musk said Only owners who paid the charge for the full autopilot system will be able to activate all of the autopilot features but Musk said the side impact warning is a safety feature and will be available to everyone For the next update Musk said Tesla is working on having the car drive itself in and out of garages when it s summoned by the owner Karl Brauer a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book said Tesla s system appears to up the ante for the industry General Motors Super Cruise system for example which is due out on the Cadillac CT will let drivers take their hands off the wheel at any speed on the highway but it won t change lanes by itself Competitors race to match features This is the game we re going to be playing round and round for the next five to years until there s fully autonomous driving Brauer said Each time there s a step by someone out there everyone will have to match it Brauer said there s a danger to that because people may not know what the car they re driving is capable of Having that kind of nebulous blurry grey zone could introduce many more problems he said But Musk is optimistic about the benefits of autopilot In the long term it will be safer than a person driving he said with files from CBC News
Commerce seeks to widen acceptance of cyber framework By Mark Rockwell Oct More than a year after the federal Cybersecurity Framework was introduced industry executives and federal officials say companies are learning to work with it but there are still some obstacles The framework was driven by President Barack Obama s executive order on cybersecurity and unveiled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology last spring It seeks to promote cybersecurity best practices in the private sector Adherence is voluntary and its backers say success lies in industry s willingness to adopt recommendations and use their experience to build on NIST s best practices There is a delicate and important balance in how NIST interfaces with the regulatory and commercial said Clete Johnson chief counsel for cybersecurity at the Federal Communications Commission s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau We wanted a voluntary process but an active voluntary process that would engage companies in consulting on best practices he said at USTelecom s National Cybersecurity Policy Forum on Oct The FCC works with telecommunications companies one of designated critical infrastructure groups that need particularly strong cyber protections We have to emphasize that using the framework is in companies best interests Johnson added Companies might be reluctant to share issues for a number of reasons said Adam Sedgewick senior IT policy advisor at NIST Companies don t come and say Here are our problems he said They need to know they re not walking into trouble such as liabilities or reporting violations The framework has worked because it s not a regulatory document said Chris Boyer assistant vice president of global public policy at AT T Industry recognizes that a regulatory checklist won t work About the Author Mark Rockwell is a staff writer covering acquisition procurement and homeland security Contact him at mrockwell fcw com or follow him on Twitter at MRockwell

One of the major transformation challenges facing South Africa is that of unaffordable university fees Universities generally obtain funding from government subsidies student fees and third stream income The latter is largely dedicated to contract research or tied to specific projects With government subsidies coming in at below inflation the only alternative universities have is to source funds from student fees We recognise that it places a significant burden on students and families especially in the current economic environment But we are caught in a pincer movement Universities have no choice but to increase student fees to remain sustainable and offer a quality education This year Wits utility bills increased by between and while the rand dollar exchange rate fell by about This has resulted in a substantial increase in what we have to fork out for library books journals electronic resources and research equipment procured in dollars and euros 
Alibaba lobbies to stay off U S blacklist list for fakes SHANGHAI By John Ruwitch People ride a double bicycle past a logo of The Alibaba Group at the company s headquarters on the outskirts of Hangzhou Zhejiang province November Reuters Aly Song Files SHANGHAI Chinese e commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is lobbying hard to stay off the U S Trade Representative s blacklist after coming under renewed pressure this year over suspected counterfeits sold on its shopping platforms Re inclusion on the USTR s annual list of the world s most notorious markets for sales of pirated and counterfeit goods while not carrying direct penalties would be a blow to the company s efforts to shed perceptions that its sites are riddled with fakes and that its anti piracy policies are inadequate It could also hurt Alibaba s beleaguered share price Two Alibaba sites the business to business platform Alibaba com and the hugely popular Taobao Marketplace were on the USTR s Notorious Markets list from Alibaba com was removed in Taobao was taken off in for its notable efforts to work with rightholders to clean up the site On September the USTR called for public input as it formulates its latest list expected in the coming months At least three industry bodies have publicly responded with criticism of Alibaba alleging counterfeits remain widespread on its sites and that the company is difficult to work with or inefficient when seeking redress The company s new government affairs chief Eric Pelletier who took up the post in June has sent two formal letters to the USTR this month including a rebuttal of the industry group criticism Last week Pelletier and an Alibaba lawyer met with an inter agency working group coordinated by the USTR to discuss Alibaba s anti counterfeit efforts a source with knowledge of the matter said In his letters Pelletier says Alibaba has gone above and beyond in dealing with the problem but that primary responsibility for policing and deterring infringements rests with brand owners according to copies seen by Reuters He said the company had made it easier this year for brands to remove listings of suspected fakes while toughening penalties for merchants who violate company policies When you step back and look at our overall efforts to combat illicit activities our track record is clear We are certainly not perfect and we have a lot of hard work ahead of us we will continue to do everything we can to stop these activities he wrote INDUSTRY PRESSURE Others think Alibaba should do more The American Apparel and Footwear Association pressed the USTR to re instate Taobao on the blacklist due to Alibaba s unwillingness to make serious reforms and failure to address the organisation s concerns The AAFA opposed the de listing of Taobao in but had not recommended re listing the site until now AAFA spokeswoman Catherine Michael said Four years of talks were not productive and did not lead to progress of fixing the problem she said Alibaba says the AAFA has refused recent requests to meet to discuss the concerns The Trademark Working Group which includes some Fortune and other major brands and ANDEMA a Spanish anti counterfeiting association that counts companies including Levi s and Camper among its members also criticised Alibaba s processes for removing suspected listings of fakes Several brands contacted by Reuters including Burberry and Adidas declined to comment directly on the issue Privately some industry sources say Alibaba has made patchy progress in fighting fakes and can be less than helpful with smaller brands or those with which it has no special agreements or memoranda of understanding to work together to combat intellectual property rights violations It was a mistake to take them off of the notorious markets list said one source at a Western sports brand who declined to be identified because the brand works with Alibaba In May Gucci Yves Saint Laurent and other luxury goods firms owned by Paris based Kering SA launched a lawsuit against Alibaba in New York for the second time in less than a year contending the online shopping titan knowingly made it possible for counterfeiters to sell the products Pressure on Alibaba has not only come from industry In January the State Administration for Industry and Commerce SAIC a Chinese government regulator criticised Taobao for counterfeit goods listings It also issued a white paper blasting Alibaba for failing to crack down on illegal activities on its sites although later confirmed the document carried no legal weight Alibaba said the methodology in the reports was flawed USTR spokesman Andrew Bates said the agency was reviewing submitted comments The list is expected to be published sometime between December and the end of March Pelletier who served as a legislative advisor to President George W Bush and previously worked in Congress has met with a range of government agencies since joining Alibaba in June U S officials were most interested in the counterfeit issue and feedback had so far been positive the source said In an interview last week with Chinese news agency Xinhua Alibaba s found and chief executive Jack Ma said the company s customer complaint rate was a low percent lower than that of bricks and mortar shops I don t believe success can built on dishonesty it quoted Ma

Reckon boss Clive Rabie who owns about million shares worth nearly per cent of the software company Louise Kennerley by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Remember Reckon Ltd Back before New Zealand s Xero was a noisy but fast growing upstart and when billion sounded like a lot of money to pay for MYOB Reckon was the accounting software sector s great hope for small cap fund managers The theory was always that Reckon which provides desktop and cloud based business management software under the Reckon Accounts brand would be acquired by its then US billion United States backer Intuit That all fell apart when Reckon stopped distributing Intuit s Quicken QuickBooks products in February and eventually bought back the US giant s per cent equity stake later that year Since then Reckon has faced life on its own Its shares have traded at and around the mark and more attention has been directed at its noisy and sometimes quarrelsome rivals Xero and MYOB which are now both worth more than billion Brokers have flicked the stock into the hold basket and small cap fundies have started digging elsewhere However Street Talk understands Reckon s hasn t gone unnoticed by at least one potential suitor The company headed by straight shooting chief executive Clive Rabie has a steady recurring revenue stream and is working on the rollout of an online model Reckon One Sources said Reckon had been approached by a private equity or trade player in recent times and the company had turned to Macquarie Capital for some advice and defensive support Perpetual Investments would loom as a key voice in any deal The fund is a long time supporter of the stock and retains a per cent stake Other major backers include UK based Highclere International Investors which also holds stakes in Australia s Webjet and Orotongroup along with UniSuper and Rabie who owns almost per cent None of these investors would be expected to part with their stock for much less than a share which would value Reckon at almost million Interestingly Reckon had independent expert Grant Thornton value the business months ago when it selectively bought back Intuit s stake Grant Thornton valued the company at to a share which represented about times one year forward earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation 
The National Security Agency is bypassing encrypted Internet connections because the encryption data is all the same researchers posited this week It has long been believed the NSA had a way to bypass common types of encryption but its methods haven t been known There have been rumors for years that the NSA can decrypt a significant fraction of encrypted Internet traffic Alex Halderman and Nadia Heninger wrote in a study Wednesday The key is somewhat ironically Diffie Hellman key exchange an algorithm that we and many others have advocated as a defense against mass surveillance Along with twelve co authors Heninger and Halderman presented their research on the topic in a paper this week Related Story http www washingtonexaminer com article In short the Diffie Hellman method uses the same data called a prime to encrypt connections When it was created the researchers wrote There seemed to be no reason why everyone couldn t just use the same prime and in fact many applications tend to use standardized or hard coded primes The problem with that they said is that an adversary can perform a single enormous computation to crack a particular prime then easily break any individual connection More from the Washington Examiner Clinton praises Obama but says she s not running for his third term She promised to continue to push for many of Obama s economic priorities like minimum wage and equal pay By Jacqueline Klimas PM In the past that wasn t considered a problem For the most common strength of Diffie Hellman bits it would cost a few hundred million dollars to build a machine the researchers said and would be a feat not seen since the Enigma cryptanalysis during World War II Thanks to budget documents leaked by Edward Snowden in researchers now know that the NSA has the budget to facilitate such a project It shows that the agency s budget is on the order of billion a year with over billion dedicated to computer network exploitation and several subprograms in the hundreds of millions a year the paper said As a result bit HTTPS SSH and VPN connections all common types of encryption are vulnerable to NSA penetration Joseph Bonneau a postdoctoral researcher at the Applied Crypto Group at Stanford University and fellow at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who did not work on the study said the study would serve to motivate the virtual community to change their longstanding practices It s hard to get people to upgrade until there is a smoking gun showing that things are broken Bonneau told the Washington Examiner Really we knew bit Diffie Hellman was vulnerable a decade ago and the Internet dragged their feet on changing Going forward we need to be more proactive he said Bonneau added that truly secure encryption in the needs to use bit keys It s not simply twice as hard to break through but many millions or billions of times harder Also from the Washington Examiner Kerry Climate change made the Syrian civil war far worse Kerry said that the already bad situation under the regime was worsened by the drought and food shortage By Jacqueline Klimas AM For those seeking to protect themselves Heninger suggested several simple solutions For percent of cases Keep your software up to date use a password manager two factor authentication and disk encryption she told the Examiner For people writing software or managing systems follow recommended timelines for deprecating insecure algorithms and cryptographic key sizes In addition to the technical issues that programmers need to cope with as a result of the research Heninger said there s a practical component for people outside of the technical community should confront as well In cases where maintaining an intelligence advantage is arguably causing current or future harm to broader security with this kind of broad vulnerability or with backdoored standards or software or by exploiting software vulnerabilities instead of fixing them we should be having a broader discussion in society for what the right tradeoff is Heninger said Related Story http www washingtonexaminer com article Bonneau concurred saying that the NSA s mission of protecting Americans at the same time it degrades system security is has been widely pointed out to be a dangerous combination because it means when the NSA finds flaws it may not disclose them publicly hoping it is the only agency that has found them Also from the Washington Examiner GOP Obama playing politics with Afghanistan plan Still they offered few specifics on what they would do differently if elected By Jacqueline Klimas AM

Rick Giner a senior developer in the IT industry Photo Meredith O Shea Rick Giner s expertise lies behind the scenes but as far as the job market is concerned he may as well be a rock star The year old front end web specialist receives an average of five or job offers every week and has worked at four different organisations in the last five years This is despite having no formal training as a teenager he mucked around on computers at home and got his first job at fresh out of high school He learnt the rest on the job For a long while it front end development was kind of seen as the little brother of programming and development really just like colouring in pictures Giner says Advertisement Just six years ago The Guardian described his profession simply speaking making apps and websites look great and work seamlessly for the user as a relatively obscure internet discipline But in the last few years with the explosion of smartphones and mobile apps and the need for websites to adapt to any device his skills have become increasingly sought after Giner is emblematic of a new breed of IT workers born out of Australia s IT skills shortage and the rapid pace of technological change They are highly mobile highly sought after and tend to upskill off their own bat The ball is most definitely in their court Richard Fischer managing director at specialist IT recruitment firm Greythorn says the Australian technology workforce of today is transient and lacks loyalty A recent Greythorn survey showed per cent of IT workers were either actively looking to change jobs or keeping an eye on the market Sixty one per cent were actively looking to change jobs in the next months The hottest area of course is digital including design people as well as technical people Fischer said App developers and people with skills in mobility analytics cloud and security as well as experienced project managers and business analysts were also in high demand he said Contract work has always played a big role in IT thanks to organisations needing to boost their staff for short term projects But it s on the rise Fischer said contract and temporary positions now make up about per cent of IT jobs across recruitment firms not just at Greythorn up from around to per cent prior to the global financial crisis Most of the time this is mutually beneficial for employer and employee Organisations can get a project sorted with minimal overheads while in demand talent have the opportunity to build their CV with each new position and have little to fear when it comes to finding the next job But a workforce conditioned towards mobility is not good news all of the time Job hopping where a worker leaves before a contract is up or quits a permanent position can have its downsides for both staff and firms Some employers will overlook talent that has had too many different jobs opting instead for someone they consider more loyal Luke Singleton of from ICT recruitment firm Spark says for the employer an inconsistent project team can also result in missed project deadlines financial losses incurred by replacement costs lost productivity lower team morale and that modern workplace bugbear stress Consultancies government and other large complex organisations such as banks are more likely to want to hang onto intellectual property and retain staff So how does an organisation catch and keep a rock star tech professional with other job offers in the pipeline The answers may be surprising Fischer says if an organisation wants to retain talent like Giner it needs to be thinking in the same month time frame and be able to communicate opportunities for professional development Investing in staff training can also pay off in a big way If employers working on a digital development project are only talking to their team about deliverables it s not enough he says Singleton says career growth opportunities flexible working conditions employer paid training and having an employer with a strong leadership team are all attractive to top talent Gone are the days when salary was the main reason why candidates would change roles he says That certainly rings true for Giner who says work life balance and the opportunity to work on fulfilling projects are both priorities when deciding on the next conquest In his spare time he s heavily involved in Melbourne s local developer community organising programmer gatherings and even launching an emerging technologies festival called Buzzconf to be held in Ballan in rural Victoria next month For him it s never been about the money People want to do more than just program he says It used to be enough years ago to sit and code in the dark and be antisocial but that s not really the case any more We want to bring real benefits to the places we work in But imparting skills and helping a place to grow and change often takes only a short period and then he says it s time to move on

By SALLY HO and KEN RITTER Associated Press LAS VEGAS AP Several state agencies that responded to a fire at a radioactive waste site in rural southern Nevada were testing air quality and checking for any other problems Monday after the flames were extinguished No injuries have been reported since the fire ignited Sunday afternoon in an industrial area near Beatty Nevada about miles northwest of Las Vegas said Bud Marshall southern Nevada regional supervisor for the state Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security It is not clear how the fire started at the shuttered disposal site which is about miles from populated areas Authorities say the site accepted low level radioactive waste for years which can include tools protective clothing machine parts from nuclear plants and other items Officials were monitoring air quality Marshall said but he had no immediate information about the results No spills or air quality risks have been confirmed Nye County sheriff s Sgt David Boruchowitz said Initial reports indicated that the fire had started at a US Ecology plant but the company said a nearby disposal area for low level radioactive waste is where the flames ignited and is controlled by the state Department of Health and Human Services The company had operated the disposal site from until it closed in according to the nonprofit Nuclear Resource and Information Service in Takoma Park Maryland The state health department and governor s office could not immediately provide further details US Ecology spokesman Dave Crumrine said the fire started about p m Sunday and that the company reported the fire which is in line with its emergency reporting plans He said no evacuations have been ordered Gov Brian Sandoval said he called in the Nevada National Guard and activated the state Emergency Operations Center in Carson City to coordinate the response among agencies Several roads have also been closed in part because of a heavy rainstorm that hit southern Nevada on Sunday The Nye County School District shut its two schools in Beatty because of the fire while Amargosa Valley Elementary Middle closed because of road conditions The closures affected about students in the rural county The site of the fire is about miles south of the small unincorporated Nye County town of Beatty U S Geological Survey studies in and found high concentrations of radionuclides underground the Nuclear Resource and Information Service said Tritium was detected more than feet below ground and carbon was found more than feet below ground which are radioactive isotopes of hydrogen and carbon respectively Radiation exposure generally can cause cell damage and increase the potential for some cancers Low level waste is solid material that can be transported under U S Department of Transportation and Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations Such material does not include used nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants or waste from U S defense programs according to the Nuclear Energy Institute an industry lobbying group It can include water purification filters and resins tools protective clothing and plant hardware such as steam generators from nuclear plants It can also include medical items and protective gear that have come in contact with radioactive materials glass and plastic laboratory supplies and machine parts and tools 
Newly launched mobile eye test device could lead to prescription virtual reality screens October by Rob Matheson Ramesh Raskar holding the Netra device Credit John Werner Camera Culture Group After five years of development and about tests worldwide the mobile eye test device developed by MIT spinout EyeNetra is coming to hospitals optometric clinics optical stores and even homes nationwide But on the heels of its commercial release EyeNetra says it s been courting offers from virtual reality companies seeking to use the technology to develop vision corrected virtual reality displays As much as we want to solve the prescription glasses market we could also help bring virtual reality to the masses says EyeNetra co founder Ramesh Raskar an associate professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab who co invented the device The device called Netra is a plastic binocular like headset Users attach a smartphone with the startup s app to the front and peer through the headset at the phone s display Patterns such as separate red and green lines or circles appear on the screen The user turns a dial to align the patterns and pushes a button to lock them in place After eight interactions the app calculates the difference between what the user sees as aligned and the actual alignment of the patterns This signals any refractive errors such as nearsightedness farsightedness and astigmatism The app then displays the refractive powers axis of astigmatism and pupillary distance required for eyeglasses prescriptions In July the startup launched Blink an on demand refractive test service in New York where employees bring the Netra device to people s homes In India EyeNetra has launched Nayantara a similar program to provide low cost eye tests to the poor and uninsured Both efforts used EyeNetra s suite of tools now available for eye care providers worldwide According to the World Health Organization uncorrected refractive errors are the world s second highest cause of blindness EyeNetra originally invented the device for the developing world specifically for poor and remote regions of Africa and Asia where many people can t find health care easily India alone has around million people in need of eyeglasses But the United States has offered the best market in terms of adoption Raskar says The consumerization of health is happening much faster here in the U S than in the developing world he says If you re to play that role of smartphone based personalized health solutions then we have an amazing lead over anyone else Personalized correction Over the past six months EyeNetra has been courting license agreements and full acquisitions from virtual reality companies Raskar says The idea he says is to use the startup s technology to develop custom screens to fit a user s eyeglass prescription Prescription screens could make virtual reality devices more form fitting for a more immersive and comfortable experience Raskar says Right now devices are built with extra space on the viewing end for people wearing glasses Vitor Pamplona Credit John Werner Camera Culture Group But it could also help solve a larger issue aligning the eye lens prescription lens and the virtual reality screen All three have to be aligned in the right way for you to enjoy the experience Raskar says If the glasses shift for instance optical aberrations disrupt the viewing potentially causing headache fatigue and nausea EyeNetra s technology measures how a user s optical refractive errors will affect how they see patterns on a digital display in an environment very similar to a virtual reality headset Raskar says Therefore companies could use these precise measurements to develop screens that are pre corrected to a user s specific refraction errors It s personalized correction Raskar says Your vision correction is built into the headset Such an approach could be game changing Raskar says as billions of dollars have recently been invested into virtual reality technology In Facebook acquired Oculus Rift for billion Google and other big companies recently backed Magic Leap with more than million and Microsoft has starting pooling resources into virtual reality research In addition to the major business EyeNetra is doing for prescriptions it can also disrupt virtual reality which is an even bigger market Raskar says User friendly optics Around Raskar and some of his Media Lab students developed a prototype of Netra A small plastic device was clipped to a smartphone and viewers used the phone s keyboard to align the patterns The device was designed as an inverse of a traditional Shack Hartmann wavefront sensor machine which shines a laser into the patient s eye and measures the refracted light with a photon sensor to find optical aberrations that affect eyesight Essentially Netra replaces the expensive sensor with a smartphone display Because the red and green light goes through different parts of the eye aligning the two colors similarly demonstrates any optical aberrations Later that year Raskar and EyeNetra co founder and chief technology officer Vitor Pamplona who co invented the technology brought the invention to MAS Imaging and Fabrication Ventures a class he co teaches that presents image based projects for students to further innovate There teams of students ran the device through several case studies researched markets and established a network of investors Over the next few months Raskar Pamplona and other students entered the prototype in MIT s IDEAS competition where they won a prize and the MIT K Business Plan Competition where they earned a spot as semifinalists Then a grant from the MIT Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation officially launched the company in But we realized we had to start all over again Raskar says This meant a complete redesign of the product and business plan to focus less on the technology and more on market need As much as we wanted to be disruptive in long run the reality of the world was that we had to work with really good partners he says EyeNetra teamed up with the LV Prasad Eye Institute and Lotus Eye Institute and Hospital among other clinical partners to help conduct tens of thousands of tests worldwide About product iterations led to an improved device and better user interface For instance around three years ago the team realized that people didn t perform well interacting with the phone So for the current design they moved all buttons and knobs to the actual device That change and other small tweaks made the device easier and more widely used Raskar says We were naive in thinking that if you solve the optics problem it will be good But in reality there are three parameters the machine and its optical design the eye and its involuntary activities and the human perception he says Getting all those right in the same design is nontrivial Moving forward Raskar says EyeNetra aims to capitalize on the

New technology will help stem the tide of automation by making labour markets more efficient Supplied by Michael Spence and James Manyika This is an age of anxiety about the job killing effects of automation with dire headlines warning that the rise of robots will render entire occupational categories obsolete But this fatalism assumes that we are powerless to harness what we create to improve our lives and indeed our jobs Evidence of technology s potential to help resolve our job concerns can be found in online talent platforms Digital platforms already have transformed many parts of the economy The online marketplaces built by Amazon and Alibaba for example have reshaped the retail landscape partly by changing the local nature of retail markets Online talent platforms apply a similar approach to the world of work with a similar impact By creating regional national and even global job markets they allow employers to tap into broader talent pools and connect job seekers with a wider universe of opportunities In this way they have transformed the typical job search and are now approaching the critical mass needed to move employment numbers Such platforms take various forms Websites such as LinkedIn Monster com and Indeed com which match individuals with employers seeking to fill traditional jobs have engaged hundreds of millions of users and many of the world s leading companies and are generating the bulk of the economic impact But there are also the digital marketplaces of the gig economy or shared economy which connect freelancers with work assignments from web development to chauffeuring passengers thereby reducing underused labour and capital Digital platforms make markets more transparent and efficient which is exactly the kind of disruption that today s labour markets need In many countries to per cent of the working age population is unemployed inactive or working only part time Companies are complaining that they cannot fill open positions in sectors ranging from technology to healthcare And those who are employed are often stuck in roles that do not take full advantage of their skills These issues represent a staggering waste of human and economic potential Crude data The problems stem from the fact that today s labour markets provide crude incomplete and geographically restricted signals about the skills that are in demand As a result mapping out an education training and career path entails quite a lot of guesswork That does not only hurt workers it also means that companies needs can be left unmet Online talent platforms can boost labour market efficiency by aggregating data on candidates and job openings in a broader geographic area thereby illuminating for workers which positions are open today as well as the actions they can take to gain more fulfilling work This dynamic could be especially important in Europe where employment prospects differ radically across countries and across regions within countries and many feel trapped in stagnant local economies It is not likely that someone will move from Spain to Swaziland even for a dream job but that person might accept a better position a few hundred miles away Moreover by facilitating faster matches online talent platforms shorten the duration of unemployment while the creation of flexible part time opportunities can draw more inactive workers into the labour force and help part time workers add hours At the same time by connecting the right person with the right role such platforms can boost productivity In short while online talent platforms cannot boost weak demand in advanced economies solve complex development issues in the emerging world or create better jobs across the board they can have a major impact on seemingly intractable issues such as unemployment underemployment and low job satisfaction According to a recent McKinsey Global Institute research study they could increase global gross domestic product by trillion annually by That is equivalent to adding another United Kingdom to the world economy Much of the impact of online talent platforms stems from the use of technology to bridge information asymmetries that impair labour market performance In the past these gaps were only partly bridged by signals carrying useful information But online talent platforms aggregate much larger amounts of information efficiently increasing the signal density With expanded data companies can use predictive analytics to identify the best candidate for a given role Job seekers can augment their educational credentials and employment histories with samples of their work and endorsements from co workers and customers thereby conveying their potential value to employers more effectively Room for optimism Furthermore platforms that aggregate anonymous reviews from current and former employees give individuals a better idea of what it is like to work for a given company as well as the salary they can and should expect As employee satisfaction becomes more widely reported companies are facing pressure to ensure good working conditions to recruit the talent they need So far the biggest winners from this shift have been educated and skilled professionals in the advanced economies In fact the most sought after engineers and software developers may not need to apply for jobs at all companies are increasingly recruiting passive candidates sometimes forcing employers to increase the salaries of workers they want to retain But it is not all good news Now that employers have new tools for recruitment and assessment they may find low skilled workers easier to replace potentially worsening income inequality in the short run In the longer term however a better overall system for skills upgrading could be designed one that could be integral to facilitating upward mobility And there is another benefit in this regard As the career outcomes associated with specific institutions and degree programs become more transparent education and training providers will become more accountable for preparing their students for prosperous and productive lives With global smartphone subscriptions set to reach billion by online talent platforms have enormous room to expand into new regions and sectors As these technologies continue to evolve they may change the world of work in ways we cannot even imagine today It seems that there is room in the labour market for a little optimism after all Michael Spence a Nobel laureate in economics is professor of economics at NYU s Stern School of Business James Manyika is the San Francisco based director of the McKinsey Global Institute Project Syndicate

Image Gallery images London based artist and designer Daniel Durnin has created a nomadic floating shelter that can also be towed by a bicycle Dubbed WaterBed the tiny wooden shelter accommodates one person with Durnin hoping to bring life back to urban waterways by creating a new way to camp on the water The WaterBed was inspired by the nature and canal network within urban environments specifically London Daniel Durnin tells Gizmag It was an idea for a platform to reconnect with our surroundings and the beauty that we live within but often overlook The WaterBed offers a simple adventure experience that lies somewhere between camping and small scale tourism It was originally intended for users to set up a floating camp within an urban landscape with inland waterways or canals but it could easily be adapted to alternative city environments such as Amsterdam or New York Furthermore keeping the WaterBed on land the shelter acts as a comfortable and easy to use instant retreat without the fuss of setting up a tent For me it s the experience that you get using it its quite magical to cycle along a path and then just push the WaterBed into the water and climb aboard It s so relaxing and calming just enjoying your surroundings says Durnin Drawing upon his background in furniture design and cabinet making Durnin chose to hand build the very first WaterBed prototype using wooden materials His design of the shelter focused on simplicity and providing minimal requirements for comfort and ease of use One person can easily slide the floating shelter into the bank and a couple of ropes secure it to the land and prevent it from floating away Inside the shelter users can enjoy comfortable cushioned seating which transform into bedding at night time and a fold down side table perfect for enjoying a cup of coffee or a simple meal on the canal The WaterBed also features lots of windows and open air enhancing the user s experience with the landscape be it an urban canal river or open bushland setting Big opening windows at either end of the shelter offer views in both directions coupled with the large retractable canvas located on the water side of the boat All windows and openings can be closed with curtains for privacy and or shade The idea was always to provide a connection to the WaterBed s surroundings so I took a minimal approach in its design says Durnin I chose wood as the main material not only for its traditional use in constructing boats but also for its environmental credentials It also fits and complements its surroundings The floating shelter is relatively easy to tow on the back of a bicycle with a simple clip on attachment Weighing close to kg lb in total it is however a little on the heavy side if you re cycling uphill On the plus side the weight does make the boat more stable in the water providing a better night s sleep As this was the first prototype its most probably over engineered says Durnin I employed traditional boat building techniques and as with all boats providing good maintenance it will last a long time I tested it in Oxfordshire in the summer it was comfortable and exciting It s like being in a tent but you re on water With his primary goal to inspire people to rediscover their urban landscapes Durnin hopes to see his WaterBed being manufactured for commercial release or even developed further into open source and DIY plans I am working on the Mk version of the WaterBed at the moment and looking to expand the scope of the existing project says Durnin I m very interested in the way we see ourselves in our environment and like to challenge that so I am working on more interventions as well

Comments PORTAGE MI One middle school was built when Dwight Eisenhower was president the other in the first year of John Kennedy s term The three pools were constructed just before Richard Nixon was ushered out of office On Nov Portage Public Schools voters will have a chance to approve a million bond proposal that would build new Central and North middle schools remodel West Middle construct a swimming pool at each of the high schools purchase new school buses and acquire instructional technology that could lead to a computer or tablet for every student On the ballot with Proposal will be Proposal that seeks million for a new multi purpose stadium at each Portage high school In total the November ballot issue is million While supporters admit that the stadiums issue could face more opposition they say they are getting good vibes for Proposal RELATED Two new stadiums proposed in Portage schools Proposal My biggest thing is I want to see everybody get out and vote said Colleen Semler head of Kids First the citizens campaign committee that has been working with the district in sending out mailers making a video setting up a comprehensive web site www portageps org talking to parents and PTO groups sponsoring coffees and talking with the media I really think we can do it if everybody gets out there and votes It will be successful for all of Portage not just one particular group Central Middle was built in North Middle in and the three pools at the middle schools in the early s West Middle opened in and is considered to be in better shape than the other two middle schools It would be remodeled if Proposal passes Backers of the proposals say that because North and Central middle schools were built more than years ago infrastructure and mechanical systems are ailing and the facilities lack the flexibility for modern education During the months of discussions and studies one of the main points of contention was the possible closing of West Middle and converting it to something else Several residents urged the board to keep it as a middle school and a community survey backed that up The survey of more than residents said that percent felt the three middle schools option was acceptable with percent indicating they would approve a year bond for the three middle schools option RELATED Breaking down the Portage schools bond proposals on Nov ballot Also getting strong support was building two new pools The survey showed percent supported a new pool at each high school with the same percentage backing a bond for the pools I think the way it was handled was right with the citizens group the community forums the surveys the additional information board the school website and the final community survey said Randy Van Antwerp school board president The district also recently offered See For Yourself tours of Central and North middle schools and McCamley A small gathering of parents and a few students was shown why district staff and officials feel the older buildings are insufficient for today s learning environment From narrow hallways with sight issues to mechanical and electrical systems built nearly years ago before computers were a fact of life and education the middle schools are functional but inefficient they said Kids learn differently today said Central Middle principal Chuck Haskin as he pointed to desks and chairs in the hallway to accommodate one on one teaching and tutoring that can t be done in a classroom The building is functional We make it work But we know we could do more if we had more options The pools according to a Tower Pinkster facilities assessment have major problems that would cost at least million to repair or renovate Problems include leaks in the gutter system and pipes mechanical systems on borrowed time pools inadequate for official swimming diving and water polo competitions the depth of the pools and high utility costs On a recent day the combined water polo team was practicing at Central Middle as coach Eric Lancaster talked about how they are challenged by having such a shallow end of the pool compared to other schools with deep bottoms at each end We re the only team in the district still playing in a shallow deep pool Lancaster said as the group watched one goalie standing in three feet of water while the other goalie had to tread water in eight feet The bond campaign has been unique from the successful election in part because of the power of social media and flexibility of the district s website www portageps org The website has become information central for the bond election packed with documents minutes reports surveys a question and answer section that gets answers quickly and even a taxation calculator For example the owner of a home in Portage which is the average home value in the city would pay an additional a year or a month For the average homeowner that s the cost of one pizza a month if they vote for this Semler said The citizens committee also has a Twitter account kidsfirst and a Facebook page There is also a Facebook page at https www facebook com YES For the Future of Portage timeline While supporters like what they are hearing from some voters they are hardly complacent about their chances for success I have a good feeling about both proposals but my concern is when you talk to people everyone just thinks it s going to pass Van Antwerp said I hope that does not mean they won t vote We need people to get out and vote yes Tom Haroldson covers Portage Vicksburg and Schoolcraft for MLive Kalamazoo

 Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that s taken over our lives Steve Ballmer believes that Amazon is indeed not a nice environment in which to work Bloomberg screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk CNET Local rivalries can bring out the harsh essence in people If you have a competing entity on your doorstep you bristle at the mere mention of its name It s fascinating therefore that former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has decided to bare his feelings about Amazon In an interview with Bloomberg on Friday Ballmer was offered the perfect alley oop to posterize Amazon He was asked how he felt about Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos referring in a controversial New York Times article to Microsoft as a country club Ballmer offered a controlled beginning Microsoft s culture is very strong Then he spoke almost as the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers would talk about the Golden State Warriors You ve got to remember there s intense competition between Microsoft and Amazon he said referring especially to the fact that both companies are based in Seattle But then he soared to an aggressive posture I think Amazon is a place where people don t want to work This was clearly a reference to The New York Times article that suggested some Amazon employees cry a lot and the culture is one of continual emotional brutality This article was this week rebuffed in robust fashion by Amazon Ballmer wasn t finished Anybody who ever left Microsoft to Amazon we could count on them coming back within a year or two because it s not a great place to work to do innovative stuff as an engineer More Technically Incorrect Donald Trump blames intern for retweet insulting Iowa voters HTC defends new handset by reportedly pointing copycat finger at Apple Airbnb s ads tax San Francisco s patience It s true that Redmond has been responsible for innovative things but sometimes those things are capitalized on by companies other than Microsoft Talking of which Ballmer was asked about Apple He admitted that Cupertino has done a great job He believes though that the only competition Apple has left is Microsoft No one else is trying to compete with them anymore really seriously in hardware he said Who s really going after the Mac Who s really going after the iPad He described the new Surface Book not as a direct competitor with Mac but as a new category Perhaps Ballmer is right that the only companies with real hardware and software imagination are Microsoft and Amazon The Surface Book is an attractive thing and under CEO Satya Nadella Redmond has striven to be far more open in its attitude and its offerings He has to hope however that the Microsoft that he still so clearly loves can develop the cachet and therefore attract the appropriate talent to truly frighten Apple It s a little like his own Los Angeles Clippers They ve always seemed one or two players away from truly consistent excellence Disclosure Warriors fan

To infinity and beyond Light goes infinitely fast with new on chip material October In this zero index material made of silicon pillar arrays embedded in a polymer matrix and clad in gold film there is no phase advance Instead zero index material creates a constant phase stretching out in infinitely long wavelengths Credit Peter Allen Harvard SEAS Electrons are so th century In the st century photonic devices which use light to transport large amounts of information quickly will enhance or even replace the electronic devices that are ubiquitous in our lives today But there s a step needed before optical connections can be integrated into telecommunications systems and computers researchers need to make it easier to manipulate light at the nanoscale Researchers at the Harvard John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences SEAS have done just that designing the first on chip metamaterial with a refractive index of zero meaning that the phase of light can travel infinitely fast This new metamaterial was developed in the lab of Eric Mazur the Balkanski Professor of Physics and Applied Physics and Area Dean for Applied Physics at SEAS and is described in the journal Nature Photonics Light doesn t typically like to be squeezed or manipulated but this metamaterial permits you to manipulate light from one chip to another to squeeze bend twist and reduce diameter of a beam from the macroscale to the nanoscale said Mazur It s a remarkable new way to manipulate light Although this infinitely high velocity sounds like it breaks the rule of relativity it doesn t Nothing in the universe travels faster than light carrying information Einstein is still right about that But light has another speed measured by how fast the crests of a wavelength move known as phase velocity This speed of light increases or decreases depending on the material it s moving through When light passes through water for example its phase velocity is reduced as its wavelengths get squished together Once it exits the water its phase velocity increases again as its wavelength elongates How much the crests of a light wave slow down in a material is expressed as a ratio called the refraction index the higher the index the more the material interferes with the propagation of the wave crests of light Water for example has a refraction index of about When the refraction index is reduced to zero really weird and interesting things start to happen In a zero index material there is no phase advance meaning light no longer behaves as a moving wave traveling through space in a series of crests and troughs Instead the zero index material creates a constant phase all crests or all troughs stretching out in infinitely long wavelengths The crests and troughs oscillate only as a variable of time not space This uniform phase allows the light to be stretched or squished twisted or turned without losing energy A zero index material that fits on a chip could have exciting applications especially in the world of quantum computing Integrated photonic circuits are hampered by weak and inefficient optical energy confinement in standard silicon waveguides said Yang Li a postdoctoral fellow in the Mazur Group and first author on the paper This zero index metamaterial offers a solution for the confinement of electromagnetic energy in different waveguide configurations because its high internal phase velocity produces full transmission regardless of how the material is configured The metamaterial consists of silicon pillar arrays embedded in a polymer matrix and clad in gold film It can couple to silicon waveguides to interface with standard integrated photonic components and chips In quantum optics the lack of phase advance would allow quantum emitters in a zero index cavity or waveguide to emit photons which are always in phase with one another said Philip Munoz a graduate student in the Mazur lab and co author on the paper It could also improve entanglement between quantum bits as incoming waves of light are effectively spread out and infinitely long enabling even distant particles to be entangled This on chip metamaterial opens the door to exploring the physics of zero index and its applications in integrated optics said Mazur 
One thing I have always attempted to preach is the true value of health Good health There are aspects of everyone s lives which they are likely not to share with the world Their reasons for keeping some knowledge from the world is driven by many things but some are to the tune of not seeking sympathy regret and them probably having the ability of making life hell for themselves or someone they care about should details become openly available It is so strange that there are so many of us on this planet yet when you get robbed you keep thinking Why ME when quite frankly you re not all that special I don t mean this in a malicious way Okay maybe a little haha I too have been robbed once upon a black moon and all I kept feeling was anger The sort of anger people feel when they discover that they or someone they know closely has been affected by something such as a chronic illness In this class I can think of asthma diabetes epilepsy various autoimmune diseases and last but certainly not least cancer Now because these are so wide it is safe to assume that they affect pretty much everyone you know including yourself The worst has however got to be when it s a brother sister a parent or even yourself It is when you read and or listen to someone affected by something like this directly that you realise just how deep the cut from long term suffering really is I am not a member of the medical fraternity so let me not bore you with the technicalities What I feel is simple appreciate everything you have If you lost a right hand appreciate having the left If you lost both then appreciate having someone to care for your needs Life s not easy and we all have a painful story to tell I am no different

Uncontacted tribe s encounters with civilization fuel ethical debate Dangerous situation as tourists missionaries make contact with Peru s Mashco Piro people CBC News Posted Oct PM ET Last Updated Oct PM ET Members of the Mashco Piro tribe are photographed at an undisclosed location near the Manu National Park in southeastern Peru The Mashco Piro have recently initiated contact with local indigenous people and have increasingly had encounters with missionaries and tourists AP Photo Diego Cortijo Survival Internationa Related Stories Survival International Uncontacted Mashco Piro tribe filmed in close encounter Note CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links Missionaries and tourists are increasingly making contact with an isolated uncontacted tribe in Peru fuelling what the Peruvian government calls a dangerous situation and an ethical debate about how governments should deal with the world s uncontacted tribes For decades or centuries the nomadic Mashco Piro people have kept to themselves in the jungles of Manu National Park in southeastern Peru Luis Felipe Torres Espinoza Peru s deputy minister of multi culturalism told CBC s The Current Hear the full segment on The Current However recently they have started to make contact with nearby indigenous populations seeking cultivated food such as plantains and metal objects such as knives and pots Missionaries have also made contact with them offering them gifts and trying to convert them to Christianity Tourists en route to the national park have stopped to take pictures of them and give them gifts Torres Espinoza said The encounters could put the Mashco Piro at risk of contracting deadly diseases they have no natural immunity to contagious illnesses such as influenza and measles They are also potentially risky to outsiders as uncontacted tribes been known to attack and kill people outside their tribe What we have seen is a dangerous situation Torres Espinzo added through a translator It s an emergency that we re starting to get under control Uncontacted tribe Mashco Piro reaching out to the outside world The situation has fuelled a debate about how government should be dealing with uncontacted tribes Advocates of controlled government contact argue that tribes generally want to make contact and they re best protected if governments take the initiative But others say such forced contact violates international laws and contact often causes great harm to uncontacted people With respect to the Mashco Piro Torres Espinoza says the Peruvian government acknowledges that it is possible the tribe wants to make contact but officials are not sure of that What is sure is they do not seem to want to be completely isolated he said adding it may mean they would like access to objects such as machetes and pots but not necessarily that they would like to integrate with society and make use of schools and social services Because of that the government has cracked down on tourist companies advertising the possibility of seeing the Mashco Piro during tours and are hiring security staff along the river to keep people away from the Mashco Piro We need to be very careful with how we understand the Mashco Piro behaviour now Torres Espinoza added so we are not going one step beyond what they really want Incorrect information However Kim Hill a professor at Arizona State University who has been studying uncontacted people s for decades says if the Mashco Piro seem to be avoiding full contact they are probably making a decision based on incorrect information Hill told The Current that he has interviewed half a dozen tribes in their own native languages immediately or soon after first contact I can t impose my desire to see them pure and pristine wearing feathers and coloured paint it s not what they want and it s not what best for them Kim Hill Arizona State University Repeatedly what I ve found is they all want outside interactions They understand there are benefits of interacting with outsiders he said The main reason they re staying hidden in the forest and isolated is they re afraid they ll be exterminated massacred or enslaved He said when he first started studying uncontacted tribes he too thought it was best to leave them alone But he said that was a product of his own romantic desires I can t impose my desire to see them pure and pristine wearing feathers and coloured paint it s not what they want and it s not what best for them he said They want what everybody else wants in the world They want a chance to participate to be part of the world community He said he s advocated for controlled government contact with the Mashco Piro since after observing them going into mining camps sometimes just minutes after they were abandoned to look for bottles and cans they could use as water containers He thinks the government should initiate contact with a group of language and cultural translators along with a dedicated medical team that could stay with the tribe for two years after contact to treat them for diseases resulting from contact Otherwise he thinks the tribe is at risk of making contact with groups such as miners or drug traffickers under uncontrolled circumstances Those people are certainly not going to take the kind of medical precautions that are necessary to in order to save this tribe from an epidemic disaster Human right to remain isolated Survival International a group that advocates for the roughly uncontacted tribes around the world is opposed to controlled government contact with uncontacted tribes It s their human right to remain isolated said Rebecca Spooner SI s campaign officer for Peru International laws require countries to respect that right she added including protecting them from potential contact with groups such as miners and loggers If Peru doesn t do that she says it s because of a lack of political will People who are advocating forced contact are playing right into the hands of the companies that want to go in and develop those areas she said In the case of the Mashco Piro she said the Peruvian government is now doing what Survival International advocates The Mashco Piro have indicated they want some contact with local indigenous people to get access to certain items and the government is present to prevent outsiders from making forced contact In many cases she says making contact with the outside world can have terrible consequences for uncontacted people Often a large part of the populations dies from disease After that she added they often lose their land and so their complete identity is lost

Published on Tuesday October Submitted by Stern Curator Page views times homes and businesses were left without power in Sydney on September when workers cut a major power cable feeding an electricity substation The cable was powered up at volts Reports of the incident say nothing about what happened at the moment of severance it s hard to imagine a cable at that voltage being severed without some spectacular fireworks but there were no reports of any injuries In something of an understatement the cable s owner power company Ausgrid was quoted saying it was very fortunate to not have any injuries on this site It could have easily been a different story For injuries read fatalities The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the cable had been cut by a contractor working for the local council on a new stormwater drain curbs and guttering on Pittwater Road in the suburb of East Ryde at about pm cutting power to parts of Ryde West Ryde Meadowbank Eastwood Putney Denistone and Rhodes It said that power had been cut to thousands of families Ryde Hospital and sets of traffic lights across six suburbs leading to peak hour traffic chaos and inconvenience to commuters residents and businesses in the area Some of those affected were without power until nearly midnight Press reports conflicted as to whether or not the Dial Before You Dig Service had been used The Sydney Morning Herald quoted a council spokesman saying In preparation for these works Ausgrid together with the appointed contractor had several on site visits in confirming the location of the high voltage cables prior to excavations commencing on the site Confirmation was also made with the Dial a Dig sic service in confirming the location of the cables However another newspaper the Daily Telegraph appeared to leap to its own conclusion The workers who cut the cable obviously did not use the dial before you dig sic service to check where cables are before starting work it said but gave no indication that it had made any effort to verify this assumption The sad fact is that cable location information is not percent accurate Ausgrid s own documentation on working near underground cables warns Not all cables are recorded on Ausgrid s plans Some are missed due to errors An Ausgrid spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald that there would be a formal investigation into the incident So hopefully the truth will be revealed in the fullness of time

you know Mars San Francisco Washington we have a problem As NASA announced in Washington on Tuesday morning that there was strong evidence to suggest liquid water flows on present day Mars its live stream of the event struggled to cope A screenshot of NASA s live stream buffering its way through a major Mars announcement At times the stream hosted on NASA gov didn t work at all simply stating there was a problem getting the configuration information Advertisement Please try again later it said A back up stream hosted on video streaming website Ustream also failed to load at times throughout the announcement Another screenshot of the live stream of NASA s major Mars announcement Before the event began at am AEST there were about people watching the Ustream stream That quickly jumped to over people as the announcement s start time approached It appeared the space agency that can send people to the moon and find flowing water on Mars couldn t provide enough internet infrastructure to live stream a major announcement Even NASA s backup stream hosted on Ustream tv failed to show the content at times throughout the announcement But in a statement to Fairfax Media NASA said the difficulties came from Akamai a content delivery network used by websites around the world The problems were at Akamai which provides the streaming capability we use It affected just about anyone streaming on the Internet including Ustream which is why our streams there weren t any better than on NASA gov said Brian Dunbar Internet Services Manager at NASA s Office of Communications We first saw them last night during the eclipse and unfortunately they continued today I don t have any details on exactly what the problem was but we haven t found anything in our infrastructure A spokesman for Akamai said in a statement however that the problem lay with a third party Upon careful review the issues experienced yesterday while tuning into NASA s groundbreaking news conference were related to a rd party media player The issue was resolved expediently once identified In the US Bloomberg TV carried the broadcast but cut it off midway through after Russian President Vladimir Putin began delivering a press conference at the United Nations General Assembly The US Weather Channel also carried the stream for a short while before cutting to news about wild weather in the US Most other major news channels passed on the opportunity to even attempt to bring the news to their audiences live opting to screen earthly matters instead including a press conference from Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump or other live news from the UN According to NASA people watched the Mars announcement live stream online on their own infrastructure and on

Image Credit Robert Nyman Flickr Google has updated its Compatibility Definition document for Android which essentially tells phone and tablet makers what they need to properly run the company s latest and greatest operating system There are at least three highlights worth pointing out Android requires that manufacturers enable full disk encryption by default what exactly fingerprint sensors require and Doze mode cannot be modified Google unveiled Android Marshmallow at its I O conference in May After three developer previews Google launched the Nexus X and the Nexus P which are powered by the new OS out of the box Now the company has shared what companies need to keep in mind if they want to do the same First and foremost full disk encryption is now mandatory There is some important history here Google not only enabled encryption by default on the Nexus and Nexus but with Android Lollipop even required it for other devices The company then backpedaled and decided to strongly recommend encryption though it promised to change that to a requirement in future versions of Android Apparently that means Android For device implementations supporting full disk encryption and with Advanced Encryption Standard AES crypto performance above MiB sec the full disk encryption MUST be enabled by default at the time the user has completed the out of box setup experience If a device implementation is already launched on an earlier Android version with full disk encryption disabled by default such a device cannot meet the requirement through a system software update and thus MAY be exempted That second sentence means this is really just applicable to new devices since aside from the Nexus and Nexus almost no Android device launched with encryption by default A lockscreen is still not required but if a user decides to start using one this change means it is now no longer necessary to re encrypt the whole disk The new Nexus devices have fingerprint sensors and so you can expect that upcoming Android devices will as well While Android devices have supported fingerprint authentication before it was up to OEMs to implement the feature but as of Android the operating system can handle it You can use your fingerprint to unlock your device authorize transactions in the Google Play store sign into third party apps and check out with Android Pay The rules for implementing fingerprint sensors are as follows If a device implementation includes a fingerprint sensor and has a corresponding API for third party developers it MUST declare support for the android hardware fingerprint feature MUST fully implement the corresponding API as described in the Android SDK documentation Resources MUST have a false acceptance rate not higher than Is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to have a false rejection rate not higher than and a latency from when the fingerprint sensor is touched until the screen is unlocked below second for enrolled finger MUST rate limit attempts for at least seconds after false trials for fingerprint verification MUST have a hardware backed keystore implementation and perform the fingerprint matching in a Trusted Execution Environment TEE or on a chip with a secure channel to the TEE MUST have all identifiable fingerprint data encrypted and cryptographically authenticated such that they cannot be acquired read or altered outside of the Trusted Execution Environment TEE as documented in the implementation guidelines on the Android Open Source Project site Resources MUST prevent adding a fingerprint without first establishing a chain of trust by having the user confirm existing or add a new device credential PIN pattern password using the TEE as implemented in the Android Open Source project MUST NOT enable rd party applications to distinguish between individual fingerprints MUST honor the DevicePolicyManager KEYGUARD DISABLE FINGERPRINT flag MUST when upgraded from a version earlier than Android have the fingerprint data securely migrated to meet the above requirements or removed SHOULD use the Android Fingerprint icon provided in the Android Open Source Project Device makers have to follow these requirements to ensure the fingerprint sensor works Marshmallow and any apps that will use its APIs How exactly this will impact phones and tablets that upgrade to Android remains to be seen though it shouldn t take more than rescanning your fingerprint Last but not least Doze mode is meant to make your device use fewer resources when left unattended It automatically goes into a deep sleep state to conserve power That said even if you forget to plug in your phone before bed your phone s alarm clock will still ring assuming your battery doesn t completely run out App Standby puts your seldom used apps into a reduced activity state to conserve battery for the apps you use more frequently Google isn t letting companies mess with either All apps exempted from App Standby and or Doze mode MUST be made visible to the end user Further the triggering maintenance wakeup algorithms and the use of Global system settings of these power saving modes MUST not deviate from the Android Open Source Project It s great that Google is limiting device makers from messing with Marshmallow s power management improvements How app developers will try to circumvent it however remains to be seen If that wasn t enough for you check out the full page document right here Compatibility Definition PDF More information

The State Department was among the worst agencies in the federal government at protecting its computer networks while Hillary Rodham Clinton was secretary from to a situation that continued to deteriorate as John Kerry took office and Russian hackers breached the department s email system according to independent audits and interviews The State Department s compliance with federal cybersecurity standards was below average when Clinton took over but grew worse in each year of her tenure according to an annual report card compiled by the White House based on audits by agency watchdogs Network security continued to slip after Kerry replaced Clinton in February and remains substandard according to the State Department inspector general In each year from to the State Department s poor cybersecurity was identified by the inspector general as a significant deficiency that put the department s information at risk The latest assessment is due to be published in a few weeks Clinton the front runner for the Democratic presidential nomination has been criticized for her use of a private email server for official business while she was secretary of state Her private email address also was the recipient of malware linked to Russia and her server was hit with malware from China South Korea and Germany The FBI is investigating whether her home server was breached State Department officials don t dispute the compliance shortcomings identified in years of internal audits but argue that the audits paint a distorted picture of their cybersecurity which they depict as solid and improving They strongly disagree with the White House ranking that puts them behind most other government agencies Senior department officials in charge of cybersecurity would speak only on condition of anonymity We have a strong cybersecurity program successfully defeating almost percent of the billion attempted intrusions we experience each year spokesman Mark Toner said Two successive inspectors general haven t seen it that way In December IG Steve Linick issued a management alert warning top State Department officials that their repeated failure to correct cybersecurity holes was putting the department s data at risk Based on audits by Linick and his predecessor Harold Geisel State scored a out of on the federal government s latest cybersecurity report card earning far lower marks than the Office of Personnel Management which suffered a devastating breach last year State s scores bested only the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Housing and Urban Development State Department officials complain the grades are subjective In late cyber intruders linked to Russia were able to break into the State Department s email system infecting it so thoroughly that it had to be cut off from the Internet in March while experts worked to eliminate the infestation Clinton approved significant increases in the State Department information technology budgets while she was secretary but senior State Department officials say she did not spend much time on the department s cyber vulnerabilities She was aware of State s technological shortcomings but was focused more on diplomacy her emails show Clinton s campaign staff did not respond to repeated and detailed requests for comment Emails released by the State Department from her private server show Clinton and her top aides viewed the department s information technology systems as substandard and worked to avoid them State s technology is so antiquated that NO ONE uses a State issued laptop and even high officials routinely end up using their home email accounts to be able to get their work done quickly and effectively top Clinton aide Ann Marie Slaughter wrote in an email to Clinton on June Slaughter suggested that someone write an article to point out the deficiencies but Clinton aide Cheryl Mills argued that doing so might alert hackers to their use of private email Under Clinton and Kerry the State Department s networks were a ripe target for foreign intelligence services current and former government officials say echoing the situation at OPM which last year saw sensitive personnel data on million people stolen by hackers linked to China The Russian hackers who broke into State s email system also infiltrated networks at the Defense Department and the White House officials say and no clear line can be drawn between their success and State s dismal security record But as with OPM State s inspector general identified many of the same basic cybersecurity shortcomings year after year and the department failed to correct them records show Officials in the inspector general s office believe the department s cybersecurity shortcomings played a role in the email breach said two officials familiar with their thinking Senior State Department officials disagree They say the Russian hack was the result of a well crafted intelligence operation designed to look normal to the employee who clicked on the attachment and it was unrelated to other cybersecurity deficiencies No technology can completely thwart the most sophisticated of such hacks but one official familiar with State s cyber deficiencies argues that the department s sloppy security means officials can t be sure other breaches haven t gone undetected State Department officials say that only email was taken in the hack and that no sensitive databases were breached The National Security Agency conducted a classified assessment and deemed the breach significant and severe two officials say A State Department official said the assessment concluded there was no way to be sure what the hackers accessed Those officials and many others interviewed for this story declined to be quoted because they were not authorized to address the matter publicly Although the hacked email system was unclassified State Department personnel regularly use it to communicate very sensitive information some of which is routinely withheld on national security grounds when the emails are made public It would be valuable intelligence for a foreign adversary officials say Sen Patrick Leahy the ranking Democrat on the committee that funds the State Department is concerned about cybersecurity problems that have existed for several years a senior Leahy aide said speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn t authorized to discuss the matter publicly While many of the details have been blacked out of the audits the inspector general has criticized State for not implementing an effective risk management program Without one the department cannot prioritize assess respond to and monitor information security risk which leaves the department vulnerable to attacks and threats the IG wrote in the latest report issued last October There are also examples of sloppy management For example in the IG reported that of unclassified email accounts had not been used had passwords set not to expire had been set not to require passwords and users had not logged into their accounts between and Such a large volume of unattached accounts makes it easier for hackers to co opt one of them without anyone noticing In an inspection by the IG into State s cybersecurity office the Bureau of Information Resource Management s Office of Information Assurance found waste mismanagement and dysfunction The office required State Department agencies to fill out paper spreadsheets to track system updates and was unable to locate information in a timely manner the report found State Department officials responsible for cybersecurity acknowledged that the department had gotten behind in its compliance with standards in the Federal Information Security Management Act known as FISMA which requires for example that agency systems be certified as secure Many of the State Department systems had not been certified for many years Officials say they have made great strides in the last year FISMA is very important but it is process oriented and compliance is judged on meeting the process not whether data is actually protected Toner said State Department officials argue that their system for continually monitoring its networks for threats known as iPost exceeds FISMA s security standards The inspector general and the Government Accountability Office concluded however that iPost did not provide a true picture of the risk to State s networks AP Exclusive Under Clinton State s Cybersecurity Suffered Oscar

Johns Hopkins Microsoft to develop technology to improve patient safety in the ICU Project will connect medical devices in effort to reduce preventable harm Lisa Broadhead October Posted in Health Science Technology Tagged patient safety health it individualized health peter pronovost johns hopkins technology ventures Image istock The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Microsoft have announced plans to work together to redesign the way medical devices in an intensive care unit talk to each other The two organizations plan to develop a health IT solution that collects data from different monitoring equipment and identifies key trends aimed at preventing injuries and complications that can result from medical care The idea stems from the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality s research on checklists to reduce infections and its pilot program called Project Emerge which uses technology to restructure a hospital s workflow in an effort to eliminate the most common causes of preventable harm and promote better patient outcomes While most efforts to improve safety focus on one harm Project Emerge seeks to eliminate all harms including medical complications such as blood clots and pneumonia as well as emotional harms like a lack of respect and dignity Today s intensive care patient room contains anywhere from to pieces of medical equipment developed by different manufacturers that rarely talk to one another says Peter Pronovost senior vice president of patient safety and quality for Johns Hopkins Medicine and director of the Armstrong Institute We are excited to collaborate with Microsoft to bring interoperability to these medical devices to fully realize the benefits of technology and provide better care to our patients and their families By combining teamwork with technology designed to meet patients and clinicians needs we can make care safer less expensive and more joyful Four million patients are admitted to ICUs in the U S each year and between and patients die annually from a potentially preventable complication making medical errors the third leading cause of death behind heart disease and cancer In collaboration with Microsoft Johns Hopkins plans to revamp Project Emerge to better serve patients in intensive care environments Johns Hopkins will supply the clinical expertise for the build while Microsoft will provide advanced technologies including Azure cloud platform and services as well as software development expertise Using Azure the improved solution will collect and integrate information from several modern devices and provide critical analytics computing database mobility networking storage and Web functions The final product will allow physicians to see trends in a patient s care in one centralized location and let them access critical patient information from any hospital approved Windows device Pilot projects are estimated to begin in Johns Hopkins and Microsoft share a common vision of providing better care to more people says Michael Robinson vice president of U S health and life sciences at Microsoft Through our joint work Johns Hopkins and Microsoft will empower health professionals with easy to consume data driven insights allowing them to focus more on patients and less on technology and process This initiative is one of several collaborations between the two organizations designed to foster innovative health based technologies Earlier this year Microsoft became a sponsor of FastForward Johns Hopkins new business incubator designed to accelerate product development for health IT startup companies Johns Hopkins also recently joined Microsoft s Partner Network which provides enhanced services to the university Collaborating with Microsoft on multiple fronts will provide mutually beneficial opportunities that can change the face of the health information technology landscape says Christy Wyskiel senior advisor to the president of The Johns Hopkins University and head of Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures I look forward to harnessing these opportunities and seeing many positive outcomes from our relationship The initial build of Project Emerge was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation The Armstrong Institute Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and the University of California San Francisco collaborated on the project to develop and test the initial prototype

Printing clean energy one fuel cell at a time October by Fritz T Burgher McCormick senior Nick Geisendorfer and his advisor Ramille Shah inspect a fabricated solid oxide fuel cell created using D printing technology Credit Jim Prisching With D printing changing the world one Northwestern University undergraduate spent this past summer in the lab doing his part to use this exciting new technology to create efficient and economic energy Nick Geisendorfer won an undergraduate research grant to employ D printing technology to test the possibilities of making a particular kind of fuel cell more efficient and marketable He thinks solid oxide fuel cell SOFC technology which produces electricity from the electrochemical oxidation of fuel without burning could be an answer in the race to reduce carbon emissions Not many people are really researching this or trying to fabricate fuel cells this way the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science senior said This research experience this summer at Northwestern has really helped me figure out my future path He found himself in the right place to push the limits of his research questions Geisendorfer s mentor and academic advisor is Ramille Shah a renowned scientist and faculty member of both McCormick and the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine She leads the Tissue Engineering and Additive Manufacturing Lab where she uses D printing to create new biodegradable materials and scaffolding for use in regenerative medicine as well as unique functional D inks to be used for energy and advanced structural applications It s more of an art than people realize Shah said You can t just press go and expect the printer to create exactly what you want Nick has put in a lot of time and really perfected the printing process Previously named one of Crain s Chicago Business under Shah has watched Geisendorfer become one of the most skilled printers in her lab Geisendorfer is also collaborating with McCormick professor Scott Barnett whose lab at Northwestern focuses on improving fuel cell performance Guided by the expertise of Shah and Barnett Geisendorfer s interdisciplinary project has not only helped him discover new techniques for fabricating SOFCs but also determine his plans for the future This is another in a series of stories profiling Northwestern undergraduates who received summer Undergraduate Research Grants Read more in a Q A with Geisendorfer who recently spoke to Northwestern News about his research and reflected on his time at Northwestern How did you get interested in research I was initially hesitant to get involved in research I thought how could I an undergrad who basically knows nothing possibly assist these eminent faculty members with this work they are doing But someone told me No one expects undergrads doing research to find answers They only expect you to have questions That lit a light bulb inside of me I have questions I can ask a lot of questions How do SOFCs provide energy An SOFC is similar to a battery The main difference between them is that SOFCs are made up of completely solid materials where batteries generally contain liquid Another key difference is that batteries have an exhaustible capacity while SOFCs will generate electricity as long as they are supplied with fuel Fuel cells in general are very efficient much more so than fossil combustion What could SOFCs provide electricity for SOFCs are mostly intended for stationary power They re different than the fuel cells you might put in a car It could be the sort of thing where you buy a stack and put it in your basement to power your house but it s mostly thought of as a large scale energy solution Where are you now in your research We re testing a lot of different designs and figuring out what really works I ve been doing a lot of D printing and really worked out a lot of kinks in that respect SOFCs have existed for a while but no one has come up with a super good way to make them into complex designs We are looking at how we can either D print a whole cell or incorporate D printed fuel cell parts into the work being done by Professor Barnett s lab What s it been like working with Professor Shah this summer It s been great I ve been able to meet with her discuss the project and the direction it s headed Meeting and working with Professor Shah has been really significant to my undergraduate experience How has doing research as an undergrad impacted your time at Northwestern and shaped your future Solving research problems is very different from solving homework problems I ve found that having a place to apply materials science knowledge has been profoundly impactful and has changed how I approach my studies I approach everything with a different mindset now Knowing that I like research and knowing I want to continue to do it after this is a really positive reinforcement for a desire to go to graduate school

kids individual needs Our takeaway is that there really shouldn t be a one size fits all approach to schools she said Here are six schools doing things differently STAR School Flagstaff Arizona This K charter school prides itself on being environmentally friendly Its facility which opened in relies on solar panels and two wind generators to power the school The school borders the country s largest Native American Reservation and its students are members of both the local community and Navajo Nation The focus on sustainability is incorporated into the school s curriculum with programs like farm to school which brings in fresh fruits and produce from neighboring Navajo farms for school lunches The school also takes its students to nearby farms to learn about the environment agriculture and the local community Clintondale High School Clinton Michigan The school has a flipped classroom which means students spend most of their time in class working on projects and assignments Then they spend about an hour at home learning and reviewing the next day s lessons via video audio and written exercises We re doing this because we want to help each student progress further while they are in class said Greg Green superintendent of the Clintondale Community Schools It also helps students overcome constraints at home that prevent them from studying which is useful for parents as well Many parents aren t familiar with the Common Core teaching standard so they re not able to help their kids with schoolwork at home he said This way teachers are there if students need help Green said the model is showing promising results since the school implemented it in We have a close to graduation rate The school has also reduced the failure rate in English by and in math by Pathways in Technology Early College High School Brooklyn N Y This public high school is actually six years long After finishing the traditional four years students stay for two more and get an associate s degree that focuses on computer science or engineering Founded in the school has students of whom are black or Hispanic P Tech partners with IBM IBM Tech City University of New York New York City College of Technology and NYC Department of Education to offer its innovative model Paid internships at IBM and other tech companies have provided valuable work experience Why IBM s CEO is hiring Brooklyn teens The first cohort will graduate in but six students graduated two years early with their associate s degree said principal Rashid Davis Three of them are now IBM employees he said E Civic High San Diego California Thee Civic charter high school is located inside the San Diego Public Library The school which opened in said the library is not only its home but also a co educator for its students E s students have access to more than million books in the library its auditorium art gallery and reading rooms The school s classrooms are also unique with furniture on wheels to allow for various configurations and walls that students can write on to chart ideas problems and solutions of its students are below the poverty level said Helen Griffith the school s executive director High schoolers are exposed to classes that include medical biology biotech and bio engineering All students are also given MacBook Air computers to take home FirstLine Schools New Orleans Louisiana This K charter school network has infused food education and fitness into its curriculum All five schools two pre K two K and one high school provide students with hands on experiences gardening and cooking the food they grow Each school has a fruits and vegetables garden that students help maintain One of the gardens was started post Katrina for the community because we lost grocery stores in the area said Dominique Harris director of communication and community partnerships with FirstLine Schools She said two of the schools have teaching kitchens where students learn culinary arts and food safety with the help of a chef Students also help sell their produce in local farmer s markets We do this to teach them entrepreneurial skills said Harris The school even extends the food and health focus to parents by offering cooking classes and programs to promote fitness Harris said the school s food awareness initiative has led to students becoming more involved in eating healthily and helping to prepare meals at home Alliance School Milwaukee Wisconsin Founded in the charter high school calls itself the first in the nation with the explicit mission to reduce bullying of our students identify as LGBT said cofounder Tina Owen who opened the school with a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Most of the school s students experienced bullying or harassment at previous schools But those aren t the only challenges they ve faced As much as of the students are from low income families some are also in foster care and have disabilities Owen said the school s philosophy is infused into the curriculum and into extracurricular activities We teach them about different cultures and communities to raise their awareness and our students also go to schools in the area to spread our anti bullying message she said 
Amazon has hit back at The New York Times after it published a scathing front page article saying employees are treated so badly that they cry at their desks Bizarrely it has taken the internet giant two months to respond publicly to the broadsheet s report that it was conducting an experiment in how far it can push white collar workers One of the most shocking lines in the original report was the claim from a former employee that nearly every person I worked with I saw cry at their desk But in a word rebuttal Amazon says the employee who made the claim had previously been forced out after an attempt to defraud vendors was discovered It said another staff member who claimed to have been strafed by the company s employee feedback tools had only received three pieces of feedback during her time at the company all of which included positives It said a third staff member who claimed he had been berated in a performance review had actually been sent a report beginning with the words Overall you did an outstanding job this past performance year The response was written by Jay Carney a senior vice president at Amazon and former White House press secretary He added It s worth noting that The New York Times has now twice in less than a year been called out by their own public editor for bias and hype in their coverage of Amazon He concluded What we do know is had the reporters checked their facts the story they published would have been a lot less sensational a lot more balanced and let s be honest a lot more boring Amazon said it had attempted to have some of the claims in the Times original article corrected but said when the paper did not do so it decided to publish its own response Sky News has contacted The New York Times for a response

MADRID Spain s public prosecutor has asked the country s High Court to investigate German carmaker Volkswagen VOWG p DE and the scandal surrounding its rigging of diesel emissions tests according to a court document seen by Reuters The public prosecutor argued that Volkswagen might have committed fraud including by taking subsidies illicitly and may have committed a crime related to the environment due to pollution by its cars the document showed Volkswagen declined to comment If Spain s High Court agrees to take on the case it would be handed to an investigating magistrate and could still take months or even years to go to trial or it could be dropped Europe s largest automaker has admitted rigging diesel emissions tests in the United States and its operations elsewhere are also being scrutinized It has said that in Spain alone nearly cars mostly linked to its SEAT brand may have included the illegal software at the heart of the scandal which erupted in mid September Volkswagen s share price has suffered as a result and its long time chief executive had to quit Spain s public prosecutor is requesting that Spain s Industry Ministry which has been in close contact with Volkswagen over the case hand over all the information it has gathered so far It also wants Volkswagen to provide more details on its Spanish operations and on the software it used Spain s government had said it would try to claw back car purchase subsidies handed out to Volkswagen though it has since been more cautious noting that the incentives to buy greener vehicles were not linked to the exact types of emissions under scrutiny and may not be recoverable The Industry Ministry has stressed however than a billion euro billion investment in Spain by Volkswagen would be guaranteed at a time when the carmaker is contemplating massive cost savings euros Reporting by Robert Hetz and Jose Elias Rodriguez Writing by Sarah White Editing by Mark Potter 
A toxic algae outbreak that snaked more than miles down the Ohio River past four states is forcing water utilities to reassess the threat from harmful algal blooms that are popping up increasingly around the nation Treatment plant operators and researchers along the river were surprised by the large bloom and said it should be a warning to cities that get their water supply from lakes rivers and manmade reservoirs You need to be ready and have a plan in place said Roger Tucker who monitors algae sampling for the Louisville Water Co in Kentucky The Ohio River is proof of that The bloom appears to be winding down now two months after being detected in the middle of August It made its way from Wheeling West Virginia and past Cincinnati and Louisville setting off warnings about boating and fishing in the river Organizers canceled a swim from Cincinnati to northern Kentucky What surprised many along the river was the unprecedented size and level of toxins detected in some areas well above those found recently in algae plagued western Lake Erie The last toxic bloom on the river came in But that one covered about miles and lasted a couple weeks This year toxins produced by the algae didn t contaminate any municipal supplies along the river which provides drinking water to about million people But utilities did spend more money to fight off the toxins that can cause rashes diarrhea vomiting and breathing difficulty Cincinnati spent more per day in much of September to add chemicals to tap water And the company that provides water to Huntington West Virginia brought in new testing equipment and temporary pumps and pipes just in case it needed to draw from another river Researchers say conditions this year were just right for the outbreak Heavy rains in the early summer washed algae feeding pollutants into the river and a dry late summer slowed down the currents When you have months without much rainfall the river really becomes a series of lakes said Jeff Swertfeger head of water quality for the Greater Cincinnati Water Works Usually the river flows too fast for algae blooms to develop But as the river slows it stirs up less sediment and allows more sunlight to penetrate the water and fuel the algae growth The river changes year to year This is the worst anyone has ever seen it Swertfeger said We don t expect it again and again But we know it can happen Algae blooms are more common in lakes and reservoirs where the water is calm a year ago one in Lake Erie fouled the drinking water in Toledo for more than two days Gina McCarthy administrator of the U S Environmental Protection Agency has said that harmful algal blooms are one of the nation s most serious and growing environmental challenges Scientists say climate change and higher levels of nutrients such as phosphorus may be why they re seeing a rising number of algae contamination cases But not all blooms are toxic said Gary Fahnenstiel an algae expert with Michigan Technological University s Great Lakes Research Center Still a huge bloom on the Ohio River should be a wakeup call he said What we ve learned is these things are increasing Fahnenstiel said At the outset of this year s outbreak on the river one water utility was surprised thinking toxic algae was a problem limited to lakes said Greg Youngstrom an environmental specialist with the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission which watches over the river s health That attitude has changed he said Ohio River s Huge Algae Bloom a Warning for Water Suppliers Oscar Altercation

 October Super dark chameleon material shifts colour to boost solar power It is one of the blackest materials on Earth but it can transform light into any colour you want Simple to make this chameleon material could one day boost solar power The world record for blackness is held by a material made from carbon nanotubes which absorb per cent of light when they are layered a millimetre thick But a nano material consisting of tiny hammer like shapes made of gold shown above has achieved almost as much blackness and researchers have discovered that with a small addition it can also reflect any colour you choose Andrea Fratalocchi at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia was inspired by beetles whose thin shells reflect all wavelengths of light making them appear whiter than any artificial material Fratalocchi wondered if the effect could be reversed He designed a theoretical system that involved a tiny concave shell attached to an infinitely long tube designed to guide waves If you could build such a structure light would enter the shell and then travel along the tube never to be seen again Then using plasmonics materials that bend light along different paths and could make invisibility cloaks a real possibility Fratalocchi approximated this design with gold nanorods Advertisement At just a hundredth of a millimetre thick the material absorbed per cent of light This level of light absorption means it could be painted onto other surfaces to turn light into heat Because gold is an excellent conductor it would transfer heat more efficiently than carbon nanotubes says Yuri Kivshar at the Australian National University in Canberra But when a simple dye is added to the material its behaviour changes drastically rather than absorbing the light energy and emitting it as heat it emits it again as light but at a single frequency Everything in the visual and infrared spectrum is converted to the colour of the dye If a lot of sunlight were focused onto the material so that it exceeded a threshold energy you should be able to capture a large portion of the sun spectrum and transfer it on a single colour says Fratalocchi This could improve the efficiency of photovoltaic cells which work best with particular frequencies of light he says We have ongoing research in this direction Journal Reference Nature Nanotechnology DOI nnano Image information top to bottom The gold nanohammers credit Jianfeng Huang and Andrea Fratalocchi The experimental set up credit Changxu Liu and Andrea Fratalocchi By Michael Slezak

Respectfully I submit that any weapon which has the ability to cause fatal injury can incorrectly be made out to be the cause of crime These may well include knives more knife related murders than guns to my knowledge bricks cars pangas spears axes etc The fact of the matter is that any lethal weapon used to perpetrate crime is a tool used to ensure a higher success rate for the criminal and in itself the tool should not be blamed Limiting access to the tools is all good but how is that to be implemented enforced Asking gun owners or criminals to hand in their firearms under amnesty conditions is ridiculous in my opinion as criminals will never hand in theirs In fact I would suggest that action would skew the ratio and make the use of lethal weapons in perpetrating crime even more effective never mind taking away from law abiding citizens that could use those same legal tools to defend themselves This has in fact happened before look at Australia their gun ban and the results They are now calling for more lenient gun laws again Lethal weapons do not cause crime they enable it to be more successful Do not take our ability to defend ourselves away by putting us in the same bucket as criminals

 Atrial fibrillation AF is the most common heart rhythm disorder and affects percent of people in the developed world said Dr Denham AF increases the risk of stroke by five fold In addition people who have strokes due to AF are more likely to die or be disabled as a result of their stroke He continued The risk of stroke in patients with AF can be reduced by around two thirds with medications that thin the blood called anticoagulants But around a third of patients with AF have no symptoms and do not know they have AF and are at increased stroke risk Pacemakers can detect asymptomatic AF but are not routinely monitored for this purpose The current study investigated whether pacemaker checks could be used to identify patients with asymptomatic AF who could then be given anticoagulation for stroke prevention The study retrospectively included patients who received a pacemaker during a five year period and had not been diagnosed with AF prior to implantation During follow up clinics a wand was placed over the pacemaker to collect information on battery life and so on The researchers examined the data on how many patents were currently experiencing AF and how many people had episodes of AF but then returned to a normal heart rhythm called sinus rhythm In patients found to have AF the investigators calculated their stroke risk using the CHA DS VASc score to see how many should be receiving anticoagulation to prevent stroke The score gives points to the most common stroke risk factors congestive heart failure left ventricular dysfunction hypertension age diabetes stroke vascular disease female gender ESC guidelines recommend that patients with AF and a score of two or more should be given oral anticoagulation to prevent stroke During the follow up period patients had at least one episode of AF detected of whom had AF identified during a routine pacemaker check percent of the study population Just one third of the patients had received a pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome which is known to be associated with AF while two thirds had atrioventricular node block All but one of the patients needed anticoagulation to prevent stroke based on their CHA DS VASc score Dr Denham said The proportion of pacemaker patients with undiagnosed AF was higher than expected Nearly all of them should have been receiving anticoagulation to prevent stroke Pacemaker checks are simple to perform and our study shows that it is worthwhile using them to identify patients at risk The average time between pacemaker checks and AF diagnosis was six months Just over one third of patients waited months between checks to discover they had AF Dr Denham said Stable patients have pacemaker checks every months but our results support more frequent monitoring to identify AF Otherwise patients are at increased stroke risk and are left unprotected Remote telemonitoring would allow pacemaker checks to be done more often without patients having to travel to hospital Patients would require a computer that collects information from their pacemaker using wireless technology The data would then be transmitted to a hospital computer Telemonitoring would identify AF much earlier so that anticoagulation could be started said Dr Denham The fact that we found such a high proportion of patients with AF who should have been on anticoagulation suggests that telemonitoring is worth pursuing Although we can t conclude this from our study the cost of telemonitoring may be offset by the savings from preventing strokes He concluded One third of people with AF don t know they have it so we need to use all of the tools available to recognize it Our study suggests that pacemaker checks are a good way to identify new cases of AF so that anticoagulation can be started to prevent strokes

CORRECTING and REPLACING Stratmish Announces Next Generation of Fantasy Sports Superior Technology to Draft Kings and FanDuel Eliminates Insider Manipulation CORRECTION by Stratmish Inc October PM Eastern Daylight Time SACRAMENTO Calif BUSINESS WIRE Company URL in first and twelfth paragraphs should read www stratmish com The corrected release reads STRATMISH ANNOUNCES NEXT GENERATION OF FANTASY SPORTS Superior Technology to Draft Kings and FanDuel Eliminates Insider Manipulation Stratmish Fantasy Sports www stratmish com a provider of innovative Fantasy sports Internet platforms announced today the first skills based all comers Fantasy Sports format that doesn t slip into lotteries like the heavily promoted FanDuel and Draft Kings models do The Stratmish Fantasy Sports platform prevents insider manipulation that was recently revealed about both FanDuel and Draft Kings platforms Stratmish offers an easy to use platform for fantasy sports leagues from football to golf to mixed martial arts that is easy to implement for sports bars gaming establishments and recreational online sports outlets It gives participants a skills based format where those who finish in the top four from their group of twelve advance in the tournament This compares to competitive platforms where participants must beat tens of thousands of people playing simultaneously Sports bars and gaming establishments can easily install Stratmish for download to a user s smartphone or tablet Stratmish s small group play eliminates the possibility of employees using insider information to bet on players or teams after looking at selection trends and using them to better their odds while playing a lottery format It is this alleged insider trading from employees of FanDuel and Draft Kings participating in competitive platforms that has created an unfair advantage in competitive fantasy football Currently there is one class action lawsuit and possible FBI and congressional investigations Lottery format Fantasy sports carry the same danger of insider manipulation as the stock market said Phil Givant CEO and founder of Stratmish Fantasy Sports If athletes were comparable to stocks all one would have to do is access the undervalued player information something a Draft Kings employee could get and select a bunch of athletes that most contestants might overlook That creates fewer obstacles to winning assuming those athletes performed very well Even if company policy prohibits employees from participating in their own tournaments they end up competing with this exploited information on other sites Even though this practice is now banned what prevents employees from giving this information to someone else The Stratmish platform eliminates this manipulation of the data by requiring that players advance out of small group play something that emphasizes skill over luck The result is an honest competition where everyone has a chance to win based on their picks The reason companies have missed the mark can be boiled down to two integral gaming features that appear on the surface to contradict one another One calls for maximizing the number of people who can play while the other does the exact opposite and wants to minimize how many can participate This creates quite a dilemma Tournament organizers like FanDuel and Draft Kings would like for as many people to play as possible because they want to maximize profits Contestants want to minimize the number of people who can play and cap the tourney because they don t want it to turn into a lottery that eliminates skill Ironically both sides lose because the current products on the market contains both elements nobody wants and the most popular models on the market are considered a capped lottery tournament that doesn t satisfy either side There are seven essential features that a skills based tournament must have to attract enough fans in order to avoid the types of lotteries everyone else is using Stratmish has all seven The best any competitor has is four The seven required features include A low entry fee A life changing grand prize Making tournament skills based and not a lottery Allowing unlimited tournament entries Giving players a solid chance to advance at least percent Providing a re entry component Permitting individuals to play multiple entries simultaneously Fantasy sports enthusiasts are invited to try and compare the platform at Stratmish Fantasy Sports platform at www stratmish com for a skills based Fantasy Sports experience that isn t a lottery Stratmish is open to creating partnerships with companies to use its platform that will satisfy Fantasy Sports enthusiasts and businesses that cater to this expanding fan base Stratmish is currently in discussions with chain sports theme bars eateries and gaming companies about deploying its platform for several fantasy sports applications To view the Stratmish platform go to www stratmish com About Stratmish Based in Sacramento privately held Stratmish Inc is the creation of Phil Givant a professional mathematician Stratmish is a hybrid of strategy and skirmish and has introduced a revolutionary playing format designed to be a game changer in the fantasy sports industry Stratmish combines the daily fantasy sports games with a skills based national tournament instead of the

Affordable Camera Reveals Hidden Details Invisible to the Naked Eye Released Oct PM EDT Citations http www washington edu news affordable camera reveals hidden details invisible to the naked eye Newswise Peering into a grocery store bin it s hard to tell if a peach or tomato or avocado is starting to go bad underneath its skin But an affordable camera technology being developed by the University of Washington and Microsoft Research might enable consumers of the future to tell which piece of fruit is perfectly ripe or what food in the fridge is going rotten The team of computer science and electrical engineers developed HyperCam a lower cost hyperspectral camera that uses both visible and invisible near infrared light to see beneath surfaces and capture unseen details This type of camera is typically used in industrial applications and can cost between several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars In a paper presented at the UbiComp conference the team detailed a hardware solution that costs roughly or potentially as little as to add to a mobile phone camera They also developed intelligent software that easily finds hidden differences between what the hyperspectral camera captures and what can be seen with the naked eye When HyperCam captured images of a person s hand for instance they revealed detailed vein and skin texture patterns that are unique to that individual That can aid in everything from gesture recognition to biometrics to distinguishing between two different people playing the same video game As a preliminary investigation of HyperCam s utility as a biometric tool in a test of different users the system was able differentiate between hand images of users with percent accuracy In another test the team also took hyperspectral images of different fruits from strawberries to mangoes to avocados over the course of a week The HyperCam images predicted the relative ripeness of the fruits with percent accuracy compared with only percent for a typical camera It s not there yet but the way this hardware was built you can probably imagine putting it in a mobile phone said Shwetak Patel Washington Research Foundation Endowed Professor of Computer Science Engineering and Electrical Engineering at the UW With this kind of camera you could go to the grocery store and know what produce to pick by looking underneath the skin and seeing if there s anything wrong inside It s like having a food safety app in your pocket Patel said Hyperspectral imaging is used today in everything from satellite imaging and energy monitoring to infrastructure and food safety inspections but the technology s high cost has historically limited its use to industrial or commercial purposes The UW and Microsoft Research team wanted to see if they could make a relatively simple and affordable hyperspectral camera for consumer uses Existing systems are costly and hard to use so we decided to create an inexpensive hyperspectral camera and explore these uses ourselves said Neel Joshi a Microsoft researcher who collaborated on the project After building the camera we just started pointing it at everyday objects really anything we could find in our homes and offices and we were amazed at all the hidden information it revealed A typical camera divides visible light into three bands red green and blue and generates images using different combinations of those colors But cameras that utilize other wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum can reveal invisible differences Near infrared cameras for instance can reveal whether crops are healthy or a work of art is genuine Thermal infrared cameras can visualize where heat is escaping from leaky windows or an overloaded electrical circuit When you look at a scene with a naked eye or a normal camera you re mostly seeing colors You can say Oh that s a pair of blue pants said lead author Mayank Goel a UW computer science and engineering doctoral student and Microsoft Research graduate fellow With a hyperspectral camera you re looking at the actual material that something is made of You can see the difference between blue denim and blue cotton HyperCam which uses the visible and near infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum illuminates a scene with different wavelengths and generates an image for each One challenge in hyperspectral imaging is sorting through the sheer volume of frames produced The UW software analyzes the images and finds ones that are most different from what the naked eye sees essentially zeroing in on ones that the user is likely to find most revealing It mines all the different possible images and compares it to what a normal camera or the human eye will see and tries to figure out what scenes look most different Goel said One remaining challenge is that the technology doesn t work particularly well in bright light Goel said Next research steps will include addressing that problem and making the camera small enough to be incorporated into mobile phones and other devices he said The project was funded by Microsoft Research Co authors include Eric Whitmire Alex Mariakakis and the late Gaetano Borriello of the UW s Department of Computer Science Engineering and T Scott Saponas Neel Joshi Dan Morris Brian Guenter and Marcel Gavriliu at Microsoft Research

Shooting lightning out of the sky by Staff Writers Washington DC SPX Sep A picture of a femtosecond laser The laser beam itself is invisible nm but due to the formation of a plasma channel the beam emits visible white light Image courtesy Jenya Papeer Hebrew University Israel For a larger version of this image please go here Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning rod years ago to protect people and buildings from lightning strikes Someday those metal poles may be replaced with lasers A team of researchers from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Israel have demonstrated new techniques that bring lasers as lighting rods closer to reality When a powerful laser beam shoots through the air it ionizes the molecules leaving a thin trail of hot ionized particles in its wake Because this stream of plasma conducts electricity it could be used to channel away a potentially damaging lightning bolt The researchers found ways to make the length of such a plasma channel reach more than times longer a necessary advance for using the channel to redirect a lightning strike Jenya Papeer The Hebrew University of Jerusalem will present the work on October at Frontiers in Optics The Optical Society s annual meeting and conference in San Jose California USA on October The researchers created a channel of plasma by firing a powerful laser that produces a pulse lasting a fleeting femtoseconds one femtosecond is seconds The problem is that the resulting plasma stream microns in diameter lasts for only about three nanoseconds After that time the plasma cools off the electrons recombine with the atoms and the channel disappears To extend the lifetime of the plasma channel the researchers shot another laser whose beam overlaps the plasma The secondary laser which produces nanosecond bursts keeps the plasma hot and prevents the electrons from recombining so quickly extending the longevity of the plasma channel by more than a factor of The team is now working on ways to fire a more powerful secondary laser or maybe additional beams to increase the lifetime of the channel even more In principle Papeer says a longer life could also extend the length of the plasma channel which stretches for only about a meter The laser creates the trailing plasma stream analogous to the way a pen leaves behind a line of ink If the ink disappears soon after the pen makes a mark you can only ever draw a short line But if the ink were to last longer you could draw a longer line Likewise a longer lasting plasma would result in a longer channel In related work the researchers also devised a method to lengthen the plasma channel The laser beam typically generates multiple plasma channels that spread out randomly along the laser beam But by designing an apparatus of lenses that controls how the laser is focused the researchers were able to make three plasma channels that line up in sequence one after another The result is a three segmented plasma channel that acts as a single three meter long channel The beauty is that you can extend it for pretty much as long as you want as long as you have the proper optical set up and a laser beam with enough power Papeer says In fact this ability to extend the channel to an arbitrary length is the main advantage of this method The next step Papeer says is to combine both methods to produce a plasma channel that s greater in both lifetime and in length 
ASU study finds weather extremes harmful to grasslands by Staff Writers Tempe AZ SPX Oct Heavy rains and droughts are affecting ecosystems in unexpected ways creating winners and losers among plant species that humans depend upon for food Image courtesy Osvaldo Sala For a larger version of this image please go here Fluctuations in extreme weather events such as heavy rains and droughts are affecting ecosystems in unexpected ways creating winners and losers among plant species that humans depend upon for food Arizona State University investigators conducted a six year experiment on the effects of climatic variability on desert grassland The study revealed that when unpredictable weather patterns create alternating wet and dry years ecosystem productivity declines mostly because grasses diminish which allows shrubs to flourish We found that not all species could respond effectively to extreme weather events including both dry and wet conditions said Osvaldo Sala senior sustainability scientist and professor with ASU School of Life Sciences Grasses don t fare as well as shrubs which is really important to know because cattle ranchers depend on grasslands to graze their herds Humans could see a reduction in the production of food mostly cattle for meat as the provision of ecosystem services like this one change The findings were published today in the online early edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Interestingly the effect of precipitation variability was amplified over the six years the experiment lasted and we still don t know its end point said Laureano Gherardi a School of Life Sciences postdoctoral research associate and co author of the paper Therefore the effect of the expected climatic variance may be even larger and the ecosystem may shift into a different state he added The researchers created study plots in the Chihuahuan desert in New Mexico at the Jornada Long Term Ecological Research site They increased precipitation variability on each plot to mimic the projected increased in the frequency of weather extremes such as drought and unusually wet conditions Over a six year period the plots were alternately irrigated or subjected to dry conditions Shrubs did rather well under these conditions because of their growing response to annual precipitation but the grasses declined as a result of their limited response to wet years said Sala A desert grassland ecosystem could fairly quickly change into a different state such as shrubland This would have serious consequences for humans considering that a large portion of land around the world is grassland Sala added that some of the more dramatic changes to the grasslands did not occur until later in the study proving how important long term studies are as well as the difficulty of making long term predictions based on short term experimentation

in now look at it the man in Virginia wrote in a Twitter direct message to an online friend in Oregon The Virginian who went by various Twitter handles including one with Jihadi in it had been obsessively watching slick online videos produced by the Islamic State also known as ISIS brutality and jihadist propaganda much of it translated into English and other languages Now he was talking about traveling to Syria and forming a militia in Virginia Washington beat an empire with percent of the population I can do it with percent His correspondent in Oregon was Paul Dietrich a programmer and digital activist joining jihad related Twitter conversations out of curiosity Alarmed he did what relatively few are doing he tried to intervene with someone who was showing signs of being radicalized by ISIS s social media campaign Dietrich heard the man s grievances sympathetically tried to talk common sense and suggested he get psychological help Then one night he called the Virginia man stupid How am I stupid he responded Let me count the ways You are a jihadist in America who wants to start a militia and you think you ll win Dietrich wrote Stop This Madness While You Can Things reviewed One to One Online Interventions A Pilot CVE Methodology Institute for Strategic Dialogue London September The ISIS Twitter Census Defining and Describing the Population of ISIS Supporters on Twitter Brookings Institution March The Call up The Roots of a Resilient and Persistent Jihadist Presence on Twitter University of Vienna November The Islamic State Soufan Group November The Virginia man was at least talking I ll think about it Extremist groups have long used the Internet and citizens have long left home to fight for their countries enemies But ISIS stands apart in the way it s mastered online propaganda and recruitment Using st century technology to promote a medieval ideology involving mass killings torture rape enslavement and destruction of antiquities ISIS has been the prime mover among Islamist groups that have lured foreigners to fight in Syria and Iraq including from Europe and North America according to a U S government report released this week The ISIS social media campaign is a fundamental game changer in terms of mobilizing people to an extremist cause says Amarnath Amarasingam a researcher at the University of Waterloo who is co directing a study of Western fighters in Syria You are seeing foreign fighters from or countries In terms of numbers and diversity it has been quite stunning As Google s policy director Victoria Grand told a conference in Europe in June ISIS is having a viral moment on social media and the countervailing viewpoints are nowhere near strong enough to oppose them We need better ways of identifying the people most at risk of being persuaded by extremist messages and more reliable ways to communicate with them Indeed the technological response to stanching the recruitment isn t having much of an effect Internet companies close accounts and delete gory videos they share information with law enforcement Government agencies tweet out countermessages and fund general outreach efforts in Muslim communities Various NGOs train religious and community leaders in how to rebut ISIS messaging and they create websites with peaceful interpretations of the Quran But what s missing is a widespread effort to establish one on one contact online with the people who are absorbing content from ISIS and other extremist groups and becoming radicalized Humera Khan executive director of Muflehun Arabic for those who will be successful a Washington D C think tank devoted to fighting Islamic extremism says people like her and Dietrich who try such online interventions face daunting math The ones who are doing these engagements number only in the tens That is not sufficient Just looking at ISIS supporting social media accounts those numbers are several orders of magnitude larger says Khan In terms of recruiting ISIS is one of the loudest voices Their message is sexy and there is very little effective response out there Most of the government response isn t interactive It s a one way broadcast not a dialogue ISIS fighters and supporters are steeped in the vernacular of secular online culture Just like other people their age they tweet cat photos and pictures of their meals Reversing the tide will require among other things much more of what Khan and Dietrich have done What s needed is better ways to identify the people most at risk of being persuaded by extremist messages and more reliable ways to communicate with them As an example a London think tank called the Institute for Strategic Dialogue recently piloted experiments in which it found people at risk of radicalization on Facebook and tried to steer of them away It was a small test but it shows what a comprehensive peer to peer strategy against extremism could look like Distribution mechanisms ISIS differs from previous radical Islamic movements For one thing it forged important alliances to capture territory After merging al Qaeda factions with elements of Saddam Hussein s military and intelligence agencies it seized two major cities Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq a region with more than six million inhabitants at least before the latest mass migrations substantial resources of oil water and wheat and institutions such as universities Al Qaeda in contrast never controlled more than a few pockets of territory in such places as Somalia and Yemen Never before had a jihadist movement gained the kind of territory and wealth that might allow them to function like states and run public relations campaigns says Nico Prucha a researcher at the University of Vienna and a fellow at the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King s College London Second ISIS differs ideologically from other jihadist groups A few days after ISIS grabbed Mosul in a stern faced black robed man ascended stone steps in a mosque and claimed the grandest title of them all Caliph leader of all Muslims successor to the Prophet Muhammad with aims to unite Muslim lands into a caliphate much like the ones that rose and fell in the first millennium The man was Abu Bakr al Baghdadi ISIS s leader He had cleverly attached his extremist cause to a larger idea that resonates with many Muslims the restoration of the caliphate Really you are dealing with a social movement in the true sense it s no longer just a group that people are joining says Mubin Shaikh a former extremist in Toronto He has worked undercover for Canadian intelligence services on several investigations one of which involved infiltrating the Toronto a group of young Muslims charged with planning terror attacks in Today he also advises U S counterterrorism agencies and tries to intervene online to stop young people in Toronto s Muslim community the largest in North America from becoming radicalized People will make analogies to fighters joining the Spanish Civil War Shaikh says While I understand the analogy I don t think it applies This is really peculiar to the Muslim context The Muslim world especially the young Muslim world has been psychologically primed for a long time to the idea of re stablishing the caliphate It s this idea that Muslims are living under humiliation and the only time we were not is when there was a caliph It really is an idea of reclaiming lost glory Third ISIS emerged after important technological shifts Think back to when terrorists made their first beheading video in According to the CIA this grainy and gruesome piece of media likely shows Abu Musab al Zarqawi the leader of al Qaeda s branch in Iraq which later morphed into ISIS s predecessor slaughtering Nick Berg a radio entrepreneur from Pennsylvania It was a laborious task to upload this file onto a jihadist Web forum There was no YouTube or Twitter to allow instant sharing of videos or links to them Facebook was still a dorm room plaything Few people had smartphones Al Qaeda used news organizations such as Al Jazeera to release its videos and statements Today however affordable devices fast networks and abundant social media accounts directly feed a spectacularly large potential audience of young people A recent study found that the world s billion Muslims have a median age of The notional head of ISIS s media operations is a year old Syrian named Abu Amr al Shami who had been the ISIS boss in Aleppo according to the Soufan Group a consultancy whose leaders include former U S and U K counterterrorism officials The propaganda effort includes a slick online magazine called Dabiq And there s a division called Al Hayat Media which targets Western audiences It s run by a German rapper formerly known as Deso Dogg who now calls himself Abu Talha al Almani according to the Middle East Media Research Institute His oeuvre includes recruitment videos called Mujatweets in which you might see fighters handing out ice cream to children But the larger social media campaign is aided by sympathizers in the Middle East North Africa and elsewhere who produce their own content in multiple languages This decentralized approach makes it hard to go after the people producing it They can do this anonymously from wherever they live says J M Berger a nonresident fellow in the Project on U S Relations with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution and coauthor of a paper called The ISIS Twitter Census ISIS propaganda targets a youthful audience by referring to popular video games such as Call of Duty riffing on Internet slang like YOLO you only live once and mimicking Hollywood production styles The propaganda consists of more than graphic videos it adroitly addresses national local and tribal grievances For example on February videos surfaced of ISIS soldiers forcing a captured Jordanian fighter pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh into a metal cage and then burning him to death Western media reports focused on the deed s barbarity but the fire starts minutes into the video The bulk of it lays out a detailed argument for the act making connections between President Obama and Jordanian leaders between American made armaments and Jordanian air strikes on ISIS and between those air strikes and the dead and bloodied on the ground in Raqqa Under the logic of an eye for an eye ISIS had a justification for the fighter pilot s execution and the act had a clear political goal as well Prucha explains It was designed to drive a wedge between King Abdullah of Jordan who is close to al Kasasbeh s uncle and the many refugees from such airstrikes who are living in the country For good measure the text was translated into French English and Russian The propaganda put out by Dabiq the ISIS magazine includes articles geared to certain audience segments Recruitment pitches for women for instance emphasize themes of sisterhood and belonging and highlight the role of marriage and family in bolstering Brand Caliphate as Sasha Havlicek founder of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue puts it As potential recruits are wooed ISIS supporters engage them in one on one chats that are often steered to all encrypted channels In trying to understand why ISIS is so adept at all this one comes back to a simple explanation The people doing it grew up using the tools When you say terrorist use of social media it sounds ominous but when you look at it as youth use of social media it becomes easier to understand says Khan Of course they are using social media They are doing the same thing youth are doing everywhere Scaling up As he pulls up to meet me at the Toronto City Airport in his cluttered Dodge Caravan Shaikh with his gray flecked pencil sideburns looks like the year old minivan driving father of five that he is Two decades ago however he was a disaffected hard partying Toronto punk who latched onto Islamic extremism So he understands ISIS s target audience today And like Dietrich and Khan he sometimes tries to tackle the exhausting task of engaging online At one point to attract possible extremist followers he created a Twitter username CaliphateCop he later deleted it but now the name is used by another Twitter user and included a quote from the Quran in his profile He would jump into Twitter conversations and soon engaged with many people professing support for extremist causes One was Shaikh says an al Qaeda supporter in Syria How can you sleep at night knowing Muslims are in prison due to your snitching the Syrian wrote Shaikh shot back How can U claim any sort of Islam and accept the random killing of civilians Where the heck did U learn your religion Allah Al Musta an roughly equivalent to Oh my God came the reply Canada participated in the destruction of the Islamic emirate they have no innocents for their crime Shaikh countered Really Random people walking work who hav zero attachment what govt does they re legit targets The Syrian had his rationalization ready Who was the first person in Islam to use the catapult It was the prophet And we both know the catapult doesn t only hit enemy combatants Social media research has shown that messages from friends and peers are more persuasive than general advertising Other bodies of research show that youth at risk of falling into many kinds of trouble from drugs to gangs often benefit from even small interventions by parents mentors or peers But so far major anti ISIS programs don t involve that kinds of outreach For example over the summer the British government launched a tweet campaign to broadcast government messages against ISIS Some million from U S government agencies funds anti extremist projects and other community engagement programs around the world including one aimed at stanching recruitment inside prisons And there are efforts to develop new social technologies Affinis Labs based in Arlington Virginia describes itself as a Y Combinator like incubator for Muslim centric apps One is QuickFiqh in which youths ask second questions about Islamic law and get second answers from mainstream Islamic scholars made to be easily shared on social media But these efforts are aimed at Muslims more generally and don t specifically target people showing signs of becoming radicalized Shaikh and others doing peer to peer work say they re frustrated because they can t know whether the people they talk to online are the ones most at risk or are too far gone and thus a waste of effort They also want more evidence about what approaches and messages are most effective So this year the Institute for Strategic Dialogue decided to develop a systematic peer to peer anti extremism strategy First the group recruited former extremists five from far right groups five from jihadist groups to serve as interveners Next they used a Facebook feature called Graph Search to find people whose interests pages liked group memberships and other indicators showed they were likely to be moving toward extremism The interveners winnowed the list to people and used a little known pay per message feature you can pay to send a message to a stranger to start a dialogue The preliminary results showed that most recipients responded a crucial first step Some percent started a sustained engagement when the initial overture was nonjudgmental and empathetic The study pointed in a crude way to what might be possible at a larger scale Social media has assisted extremist causes but there are many ways for us to push back using the same tools says Ross Frenett who led the study We just haven t optimized that We haven t pursued that Today ISIS still dominates in the online struggle Young people continue to leave Western countries for the battle zone But every now and then there are small victories Khan and Dietrich say the young man in Virginia is seeking mental health treatment Though known to the FBI he has not been charged with any crime Having started down the path of radicalization he may be on his way back because of a few people talking to him online one on one David Talbot is senior writer at MIT Technology Review and a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University

 September Important New Data from Teva s TEV Phase B Migraine Program Published in Lancet Neurology in Back to Back Articles Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd NYSE TEVA announced today that Lancet Neurology published online as back to back articles the results from two Phase b studies of TEV a monoclonal anti calcitonin gene related peptide CGRP antibody investigational treatment for the prevention of chronic migraine and high frequency episodic migraine HFEM The Lancet Neurology ranks first among journals in the clinical neurology category Journal Citation Reports Thomson Reuters News Alert The Phase b clinical development program consistently met all primary and secondary efficacy and safety endpoints for TEV in patients and across multiple doses Clinical improvements were exhibited after a single administration of all tested doses of TEV in both episodic and chronic migraine studies These results were achieved in the presence of patients being allowed to remain on existing migraine prevention therapy and the results demonstrated significant separation in favor of TEV even in patients considered to be failing current optimal therapy The studies are available online at CM http www thelancet com journals laneur article PIIS abstract The papers under strict embargo until pm NY time Tuesday September These findings constitute an exciting landmark in the development of migraine prevention treatment options said Marcelo E Bigal MD PhD Senior Vice President of Clinical Operations Innovation and Headaches Therapeutic Area Lead at Teva We are delighted with the publication in Lancet Neurology a journal that recognizes the rigor of these studies we foresee the potential of this drug in treating a very prominent unmet medical need It is critical to understand the importance of the data published in these two studies The positive impact of this novel treatment approach should dramatically improve the lives of migraineurs said Alan M Rapoport MD Immediate Past President of the International Headache Society Clinical Professor of Neurology at The David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA Los Angeles and a co author of both studies Patients with chronic or frequent episodic migraine are often in extreme pain and severely disabled sometimes unable to leave home for days at a time I hope that treating physicians will digest these studies with the same level of excitement and hope that I have In my opinion we are on a path to dramatic and unprecedented progress in the management of this incapacitating condition The Chronic Migraine Study ClinicalTrials gov Identifier NCT Both assessed doses of TEV loading of mg followed by monthly injections of mg or mg were significantly superior to placebo in reducing relative to baseline the number of headache hours primary endpoint p and p and the number of headache days of moderate or severe intensity in month secondary endpoint p and p Consistent clinical improvements were evident as early as one month after treatment initiation demonstrating a rapid onset of relief Post hoc analysis indicated that over half of the patients in both dose groups experienced a or more decrease in headache frequency p for both doses vs placebo nearly one third of patients in both dose groups had a decrease in headache frequency p for both doses and around were totally free of headaches at month three Treatment with TEV was also associated with statistically significant decreases in acute drug consumption in parallel These results were achieved amongst highly severe chronic migraine patients suffered from migraines for a mean period of years with approximately migraine days per month who were allowed to remain on other migraine prevention therapies The High Frequency Episodic Migraine HFEM Study ClinicalTrials gov Identifier NCT This is the first study to report on more than one dose of a monoclonal anti CGRP antibody for the preventive treatment of HFEM and the study was highly positive especially considering the severity of the disorder Participants had migraine for nearly to decades with a mean of migraine days per month and headache days per month Following weeks both doses of TEV mg and mg exceeded primary and secondary endpoints achieving statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in mean monthly migraine days and monthly headache days as well as significantly diminished number of days and hours of headaches of at least moderate severity A decrease of at least of migraine days for the duration of the study were seen in p and p of the individuals given mg and mg correspondingly versus of those receiving placebo A decrease of at least in episodic migraine days was observed in p and in p of the individuals given placebo mg and mg respectively Design and analyses also had the same rigor of a phase trial In both studies no treatment related serious adverse events were reported with use of TEV No relevant differences in the rate of treatment emergent adverse events occurred for those receiving TEV doses relative to placebo Anti drug antibodies for TEV and present before drug exposure detected an optimized assay of regulatory quality and much lower than detected with other monoclonal anti CGRP antibodies About TEV TEV is a monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene related peptide CGRP a well validated target in migraine CGRP signaling may be disrupted by targeting the ligand itself or its receptor Teva s approach targets the ligand thus allowing for some CGRP signaling during therapy This avoids the potential effects of a long term total disruption to the normal physiological functions of the CGRP system which are unknown TEV administered as a once monthly subcutaneous injection is being developed for both chronic migraine and high frequency episodic migraine About Migraine Global prevalence of migraine is estimated to be almost Migraine was ranked seventh highest among specific causes of disability globally responsible for of all Years Lost to Disability YLDs Migraine is by a wide margin the leading cause of disability among neurological disorders accounting for over half of all YLDs attributed to these J Headache Pain http www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC In the United Kingdom for example some million working or school days are lost every year because of migraine alone http www who int mediacentre factsheets fs en Approximately million Americans mostly women suffer from Chronic Migraine Chronic migraine is characterized by headaches on at least days per month Chronic migraine patients are often referred to as the invisible population due to the isolating nature of the condition where patients are left in many cases effectively house bound Chronic migraine imposes a considerable burden on patients magnified by the paucity of approved treatment options for this condition More than one in four of all migraineurs are candidates for preventive therapy and a substantial proportion of those who might benefit from prevention do not receive it Consequently the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine continues to present considerable challenges and there remains a significant medical need for new safe and effective migraine prophylaxis options Episodic Migraine impacts up to of the population and approximately of women globally High frequency episodic migraine substantially impacts the individual their family and society Episodic migraine is the most common neurological condition more prevalent than diabetes epilepsy and asthma combined About Teva

Ramallah Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has threatened to drop a bombshell in a speech to the United Nations this week prompting speculation that he will sever ties with Israel over its settlement expansion and other hard line policies The warning reflects desperation but may not signal action Abbas hopes of setting up a Palestinian state through negotiations with Israel have been derailed and a new poll shows that a majority of Palestinians want the year old to resign and dissolve his self rule government the Palestinian Authority Many no longer believe a two state solution is realistic and support political violence Abbas could try to align himself with a frustrated public by shifting to a more confrontational policy including ending security cooperation with Israeli troops against a shared foe the Islamic militant Hamas group

Part of a ZDNet Special Feature IT Budgets A CIO s Guide How should CIOs deal with legacy technology Just because tech is old that doesn t mean it isn t adding value But what should tech chiefs do to make the most of their existing infrastructure Topic IT Budgets A CIO s Guide Holding onto legacy tech for too long can be a bad idea Image iStock While a combination of cloud big data mobile and social technology can provide a more flexible platform for business change many IT directors attempts to make the most of these systems and services are hamstrung by their firms reliance on outdated platforms Research from Hitachi Consulting suggests as many as percent of IT decision makers believe legacy systems are holding their organisations back from deploying digital technologies to innovate or make operational efficiencies More than a third of CIOs believe legacy systems are a barrier for the majority if not all projects So how should IT leaders deal with older technology Should legacy tech always be considered an encumbrance or can it offer benefits too Take stock of what your organisation is running Former Tullow Oil CIO Andrew Marks advises newly appointed technology chiefs to understand the value that each component of their infrastructure contributes to the whole Rather than rip and replace add more IT or simply do nothing I would encourage a new CIO to understand the budget as a build from the bottom up he says Marks urges technology chiefs to think of budgeted IT spend as a spreadsheet with columns for each of the five key areas item description the role it plays in delivering corporate objectives the value the item generates or the price of doing without it the cost and the net value Read this Read More That provides a great way to understand how the budget has been spent he says My advice for any legacy IT is to look at the cost identify the value it adds to the organisation or the cost of running the process without the technology and to determine if there is net value Focusing on value is an approach that chimes with Claranet UK CIO Andy Wilton Rather than seeing legacy infrastructure as a problem IT leaders should focus on the business opportunity The trick is to put your finger on what it is the legacy systems do rather than obsess over what they are he says Squeezing the most out of your infrastructure without incurring costs is about getting creative legacy says Wilton does not have to mean outdated There is a fine line to walk when it comes to updating legacy infrastructure CIOs are naturally keen to get the most bang for their buck in terms of their investments in capital assets Most will wait until the end of the natural technology refresh cycle before say taking the opportunity to move to cloud or managed services he says But there are times when upgrading early will be beneficial Good IT that can support the business translates to tangible competitive advantage so if legacy is holding you back upgrading early will pay dividends Make a decision about how IT supports business strategy An example of a CIO who has taken stock of his firm s infrastructure is Richard Norris head of IT and business change at Reliance Mutual Insurance Limited He has worked hard since his appointment in to both push a digital transformation and to update the firm s operational IT The firm for example has deployed the desktop virtualisation product VMware Horizon View sitting on Pivot hardware We ve taken the business from an old Unix based desktop to a new Windows based desktop he says That s been a big journey for users across the organisation But it has allowed us to deploy other tools for the business that will run in a Windows environment Norris says he is now starting to look at modifying some of the firm s legacy applications His aim will be to be run these bespoke tools on a Windows platform In terms of the business that re platforming exercise will provide a really big impact he says Adam Gerrard CIO at Yodel is another IT leader who has faced the challenge of legacy IT head on The experienced executive became CIO for the parcel delivery specialist in July and a significant proportion of his first year in situ involved understanding both his firm s long term objectives and its underlying technology base The firm has traditionally relied on a large amount of legacy infrastructure having been formed through a merger and rebranding exercise Yodel was formed by the Home Delivery Network s acquisition of the UK domestic business of DHL in The combined business was rebranded as Yodel in May Read this

New infrared camera detects gas leaks in industry October A spin off of the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid UC M Sensia Solutions has developed a new low cost infrared camera that makes it possible to quickly and efficiently detect gas leaks that can occur in different industrial facilities Credit uc m This company s invention supported by the Business Incubator at the UC M Science Park is based on technology patented by researchers from the UC M Infrared Laboratory initialled LIR in Spanish and can detect gas leaks that are normally invisible to the human eye thanks to a camera that recognizes the infrared signature of these compounds infrared is electromagnetic and thermal radiation with longer wavelengths than visible light The system called Gas Sensing System GSS makes it possible to visualize a wide range of gases of industrial interest such as methane natural gas liquefied petroleum gases coolants etc The benefits of the GSS have been validated through pilot prototypes in different industrial environments like gas treatment stations regasification plants steelworks thermosolar plants etc There are several gas detecting instruments already on the market but none have the advantages of this new method according to its creators working remotely in real time intuitively and at a cost that is five to ten times lower The equipment can provide service in any industrial plant where chemical processes are involved and there is a risk of gas leak explained Francisco Cort s CEO of Sensia Solutions In this regard they have portable equipment which allows a technician to make periodic inspections although they can also install a permanent monitoring system in a factory within a closed circuit TV that generates automatic alerts when it detects a leak This feature is very important in explosive gas installations for example because the system has an additional unit for early and automatic detection of fire Lastly the system can also be placed on drones unmanned aerial vehicles to inspect installations from the sky something that could be very useful for gas pipelines The GSS is currently being implemented in industry as a result of the great interest it has aroused among large companies especially from the oil and gas sector In addition for the development of the business plan Sensia has help from the SME Instrument part of the European Horizon program which has described the project as excellent This video is not supported by your browser at this time Scientists develop new technology to detect deep sea gas leaks October A new ultra sensitive technology which can monitor leaks from underwater gas pipelines has been developed by scientists at the University of Southampton Researchers develop an infrared camera that detects one of the main causes of acid rain March A spin off of the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid UC M SENSIA Solutions has developed the first infrared camera for detecting sulfur dioxide SO a gas that is considered one of the greatest causes of the acid rain Mars rover technology adapted to detect gas leaks October Phys org In collaboration with NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California Pacific Gas and Electric Company PG E announced that it is testing state of the art technology adapted from NASA s Mars rover Methane emissions from natural gas industry higher than previously thought February World leaders are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but it s unclear just how much we re emitting In the U S the Environmental Protection Agency EPA has a new program to track these emissions but scientists Optics nanotechnology combined to create low cost sensor for gases April Engineers have combined innovative optical technology with nanocomposite thin films to create a new

Unveiling distribution of defects in proton conductors by Staff Writers Sendai Japan SPX Oct This figure shows the crystal structure of Sc doped BaZrO to be used as an electrolyte material in intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells IT SOFCs By using a nuclear magnetic resonance NMR technique the distribution of proton and oxygen vacancy in Sc doped BaZrO was clarified Green blue purple and red spheres represent Ba Zr Sc cations and oxide ions in the Sc doped BaZrO respectively In this material a proton gold sphere having one positive charge is known to be trapped around the Sc cation purple sphere since the Sc site possesses one negative charge the trapped proton is the cause of low proton conductivity at the intermediate temperature range Meanwhile when an oxide ion red sphere is vacant center position in this case the pair of the vacancy and Sc now possesses one positive charge The positive charge works to liberate the trapped proton from nearby Sc to nearby Zr blue sphere This change in proton distribution is believed to improve the proton conductivity of Sc doped BaZrO Image courtesy Hitoshi Takamura For a larger version of this image please go here Solid oxide fuel cells SOFC recently used as a power source for households in Japan have several drawbacks such as high cost material degradation and long start up time derived from high operating temperatures up to C Lowering the operating temperature to an intermediate range of C would in effect enable the use of low cost materials and allow for a quicker start up which in turn could lead to wider commercial use and application to a mobile power source A team of researchers at Tohoku University in Japan has developed a new idea to improve proton conductivity in rare earth doped BaZrO perovskite type proton conductors Rare earth doped BaZrO is a promising candidate material for intermediate temperature SOFCs However further improvement of proton conductivity is required for practical use In the journal Chemistry of Materials from ACS publications the researchers suggest a strategy to improve the mobility of protons by controlling oxygen vacancies as well as protons Protons are known to be trapped around a rare earth element in the doped BaZrO which lowers the proton conductivity This proton trapping is originated from the electrostatic attractive interaction between a negatively charged rare earth element and a positively charged proton However when the pairing of a rare earth element and an oxygen vacancy is created in the material this pair possesses a positive net charge and therefore inhibits the trapping of protons due to the electrostatic repulsive interaction In developing this idea the team clarified the distribution of protons and oxygen vacancies in Sc doped BaZrO by combining nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis When a certain amount of oxygen vacancies mol exists in the material the proton concentration around Zr is higher than that around the rare earth element which indicates protons with less influence from the trapping effects of the rare earth element Fig Because the attractive interaction between the rare earth element and protons causes the proton trapping introducing another defect having positive charges that is to say oxygen vacancy appears to liberate the trapped protons said Hitoshi Takamura who led the research at Tohoku University He and his colleagues have clarified that the interaction between the rare earth element and oxygen vacancy does prevent the proton trapping This idea can be applied not only to the development of ionic conductors but also other materials such as fluorescent and catalyst materials since the interaction of defects plays an important role in these materials said Takamura If the distribution of defects becomes controllable we can design a variety of functional materials That is our goal for this research Authors Itaru Oikawa and Hitoshi Takamura Title Correlation among Oxygen Vacancies Protonic Defects and the Acceptor Dopant in Sc Doped BaZrO Studied by Sc Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Journal Chemistry of Materials

Raise smoking age to US pediatricians urge October by Tara Haelle Healthday Reporter And regulate e cigarettes the same way as other tobacco products doctors add HealthDay The minimum age to purchase tobacco products and e cigarettes should be raised to across the United States according to a new policy recommendation released Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics The strong statement by the nation s leading pediatricians group was among more than two dozen recommendations aimed at tightening regulations on cigarettes e cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine products to reduce youth smoking and nicotine addiction The group also called for the U S Food and Drug Administration to regulate e cigarettes the same way it regulates other tobacco products Most adolescents don t use just one nicotine product but will commonly use or experiment with several said Dr Harold Farber lead author of two of the statements and a pediatric pulmonologist at Texas Children s Hospital Research to date shows that adolescents who experiment with e cigarettes and conventional cigarettes are much more likely to go on to become regular cigarette smokers and less likely to stop cigarette smoking The new policies were presented Monday at the group s national conference and published online simultaneously in the journal Pediatrics Currently only Hawaii and about cities and communities in several other states have a law requiring a minimum age of to purchase tobacco products according to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids As the brain matures the ability to make decisions with important health consequences should likewise improve said Dr Danelle Fisher vice chair of pediatrics at Providence Saint John s Health Center in Santa Monica Calif Thus slightly older young adults may choose to forgo tobacco products suggested Fisher who was not involved with the new policy recommendations In addition older teens often buy tobacco products for younger ones Farber said He added that communities requiring buyers to be at least have seen youth smoking rates drop Another policy recommendation aimed at reducing adolescents attraction to smoking using hookah pipes or vaping the term for using e cigarettes would outlaw all flavors used in tobacco or nicotine products including menthol in cigarettes and the various flavors in e cigarettes With flavors like peach grape cotton candy gummy bear and so on what you have is essentially highly addictive candy Farber said Other flavors such as menthol decrease the natural harshness of tobacco smoke and flavored products introduce youth to a lifetime of tobacco dependence More youths used e cigarettes than any other tobacco product in according to the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In addition to calling for FDA control of e cigarettes the AAP recommended that smoke free laws expand to include e cigarettes The group recommends that use of any tobacco or nicotine products including e cigarettes be banned in all workplaces schools dormitories bars restaurants health care facilities sidewalks parks recreational and sports facilities entertainment venues and multi unit housing The jury on e cigarettes remains out but it is clear that carcinogens and potentially harmful substances are nonetheless present in this alternate nicotine delivery system said Dr Jack Jacoub director of thoracic oncology at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center s MemorialCare Cancer Institute in Fountain Valley Calif Jacoub who was not involved with the policy recommendations said that these bans would highlight that using e cigarettes is a potentially harmful thing to do and hopefully will emphasize to teens young adults and parents that one should not be reassured that it is safe Other policy recommendations include a ban on Internet sales of e cigarettes a tax on e cigarettes at the same rate as traditional cigarettes and a requirement for adult ratings on any entertainment depicting e cigarette use The AAP also recommended banning advertising of tobacco products and e cigarettes in all media including television radio print billboards signs and online and in stores where children and teens might see them Another major recommendation called for child resistant packaging for liquid nicotine Poison control centers receive more than calls per month for accidental ingestion of nicotine for e cigarettes the AAP noted and one toddler died last year from swallowing some Toddlers and young children love to explore new things and to put things in their mouths so it is imperative that packaging and childproofing be done to enhance the safety of their environments Fisher said This is analogous to having childproof caps on pill bottles 
Web Future of Tech Advancements Bring Challenges Questions From printable homes to digital human enhancement implants one industry expert said the blessing of advancing technology will not come without costs of one kind or another by Eyragon Eidam September Roger Duncan a research fellow with the Energy Institute at the University of Texas discusses the future of technology and the connectivity of the world around us during the Michigan Digital Government Summit Eyragon Eidam LANSING Mich There is truly no telling where advancing technology could take us at least that was the message delivered to guests at the Michigan Digital Government Summit Tuesday afternoon From the perspective of Roger Duncan a research fellow with the Energy Institute at the University of Texas the potential for technological advances seem limited only by our willingness to pursue them But with every step forward we take the positives of participation must be carefully weighed against the potential issues associated with it As Duncan and others in his field see it nanotechnology and the ability to build smaller smarter embeddable computers will bring both new challenges and questions for users and society as a whole RELATED Can the Internet of Things Transform Public Services While the microscopic technology could bring us houses that can literally restructure themselves it also could enable biometric applications raising questions as basic as employment rights for altered and unaltered people Implants are the next step and we re not that far away from them But it raises an issue There will be some people who want to go that far and others who don t he said How far are we going to develop classes Are we going to have classes of enhanced and unenhanced people Are there going to be job descriptions that require a computer enhancement and technology to perform the job The ability to build from the ground up with tools like D printers and the production of new materials at the atomic level will result in higher quality products cost savings and seemingly unbounded potential Duncan didn t limit his talk to speculation about tiny tech He also touched on the realities of the vastly expanding Internet of Things IoT and where we will undoubtedly find ourselves in the coming years The increasing connectivity between our homes cars and even our persons will allow for streamlined decentralized smart power grids and ultimately more a more efficient world Duncan said Refrigerators communicating with toasters is no longer the stuff of sci fi novels but Duncan contends we will see even more advanced communication and action from our appliances and homes He warns that while we will use these tools to simplify our daily lives we will also inherently sacrifice some level of privacy as the connected world around us learns more about our personal preferences The Internet is going to know where you are what you re doing he said and through predictive analysis it will know what you re going to do probably better than you do The bottom line is in the future you will not need to access the Internet the Internet will be accessing you If that sounds a little creepy it s only because it is a little creepy In tandem with nanotechnology and the ability for machines to learn Duncan said robotics will continue to advance to unprecedented levels spurring the need for humans to evaluate their relationship with machines While machines are now used as a means of enhancing our capabilities the future could see complete automation of certain jobs and roles in society The transportation sector was among the first to witness robotic automation with developing technology like the driverless car Duncan said He predicts similar technologies will soon be implemented in the buildings we live and work in To a certain extent this has already begun with things like the Nest thermostat which monitors the habits of users to establish a predictive automated profile But automation will come at a cost to humans warns Duncan According to an Oxford study he said an estimated percent of jobs will be affected by an increasingly robotic workforce While the expert said machines and blossoming technology are far from the adversarial predictions made by theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and Tesla s Elon Musk earlier this year the pace of progress could eventually lead to seemingly conscious machines with little use for their human counterparts I have chosen my words carefully here I am not saying that I think machines will become conscious I have no way of knowing if a machine ever becomes conscious the same way I can t know if any other human experiences consciousness the way I experience it But what I am saying is that more and more we have designed our technology in such a way that we can interact with our technology as if it were sentient Until that distant point Duncan has high hopes for the IT sector which he sees as the likely stewards of the digital world So what is the role of IT in this he said What happens when everything around you is smart and everything is connected and everything is interacting with you What happens is everything becomes an IT problem His solution is far from turning our backs to technology He advocates instead for self control on the part of participants and likens seductive technology to an addictive drug For those in IT he points to new skills that will likely change the way business is done on a daily basis Not only will IT workers need to communicate with one another but they will undoubtedly communicate directly with seemingly sentient machines as well Eyragon Eidam Staff Writer Eyragon Eidam is a staff writer for Government Technology magazine He lives in Sacramento Calif

Funding IT projects in an era of constrained budgets By Mark Rockwell Oct Meeting federal agencies IT needs takes creative shrewd thinking according to top IT managers who spoke at ACT IAC s Executive Leadership Conference in Williamsburg Va We have to do things differently said Anne Rung administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in a keynote panel discussion on Oct Going through pages of federal acquisition regulations spending a year developing an IT solution then another year putting together a contract won t work anymore With budgets and appropriations tight getting funding for specific IT projects is a particular challenge for agencies according to other panel participants However involving financial executives earlier in the process can help Get the budget people upfront said Kathleen Turco chief financial officer at the Veterans Health Administration Financial officers can sometimes find money for a project if they are included in discussions she added and the new acquisition law should be fostering closer collaboration between financial officers and CIOs to determine how to fund the most pressing projects Rung said another strategy for keeping costs down and efficiently completing projects is using existing governmentwide IT contracts instead of issuing expensive one off contracts Identifying where agencies have the biggest issues with procurement will also help she said OFPP expects to hear back from contractors about their experiences with federal procurement in November under the agency s Acquisition program Rung unveiled that tool in March as a way to get transaction based feedback for major IT acquisitions The program solicits feedback in several directions from contractors to the government from the program office to the contracting office and from the contracting office to the program office The goal is to aggregate data to learn what is working and where improvements are needed she said Mary Davie assistant commissioner of the General Services Administration s Office of Integrated Technology Services said the agency s category management initiative is also a key part of the effort to make all government procurement more efficient One of the most important components of category management the Acquisition Gateway is growing fast GSA officials said at the conference The gateway aggregates a wide array of information on products and services bought by the federal government Laura Stanton acting assistant commissioner of GSA s Office of Strategy Management said the gateway has product categories up from only three IT hardware IT software and administrative support last October Getting and retaining new IT workers can be as tricky as acquiring and using new technology In another panel discussion Federal Communications Commission CIO David Bray said attracting new talent could involve tapping pools of workers with particular skills for particular projects rather than hiring a specific person for a specific job For example Bray said the Taiwanese government hires several thousand workers to help write code for projects He added that another approach could be to hire workers for federal service in general and then workers with a particular set of skills could be assigned to agencies that need them About the Author Mark Rockwell is a staff writer covering acquisition procurement and homeland security Contact him at mrockwell fcw com or follow him on Twitter at MRockwell

Spacecraft discovers thousands of doomed comets October For an astronomer discovering a comet can be the highlight of a lifetime Great comets carry the names of their discoverers into history Comet Halley Comet Lovejoy Comet Hale Bopp are just a few examples Imagine the frustration though if every time you discovered a comet it was rapidly destroyed Believe it or not this is what happens almost every day to the most prolific comet hunter of all time The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory better known as SOHO is a joint project of the European Space Agency or ESA and NASA Orbiting the sun at million km or miles from Earth the distant observatory has just discovered its th comet more than any other spacecraft or astronomer And just about all of SOHO s comets have been destroyed They just disintegrate every time we observe one said Karl Battams a solar scientist at the Naval Research Labs in Washington D C who has been in charge of running the SOHO comet sighting website since SOHO sees comets that pass very close to the sun and they just can t stand the intense sunlight The overwhelming majority of SOHO s comet discoveries belong to the Kreutz family Kreutz sungrazers are fragments from the breakup of a single giant comet thousands of years ago They get their name from th century German astronomer Heinrich Kreutz who studied them in detail On average a new member of the Kreutz family is discovered every three days Unfortunately for these small comets their orbits swoop perilously close to the sun There s only one Kreutz comet that made it around the sun Comet Lovejoy And we are pretty confident it fell apart a couple of weeks afterwards says Battams Although SOHO s comets are rapidly destroyed they nevertheless have great scientific value For instance the comets tails are buffeted and guided by the sun s magnetic fields Watching how the tails bend and swing can tell researchers a great deal about the sun s magnetic field Prior to the launch of SOHO in only a dozen or so comets had ever even been discovered from space while some had been discovered from the ground since SOHO has turned the tables on these figures making itself the greatest comet hunter of all time But SOHO hasn t reached this lofty perch alone The spacecraft relies on people who sift through its data Anyone can help because SOHO s images are freely available online in real time Many volunteer amateur astronomers scan the data on a daily basis for signs of a new comet The result of SOHO comets have been found by citizen scientists Whenever someone spots a comet they report it to Battams He goes over the imagery to confirm the sighting and then submits it to the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams which gives it an official name And the name is you guessed it SOHO While comets spotted from the ground are named after the person who first discovered them comets first observed by a space based telescope are named after the spacecraft The th comet discovered was named SOHO Naturally it has already been destroyed SOHO doesn t mind though The Greatest Comet Hunter Ever has already moved on to the next sungrazer SOHO anyone

It was time to do something about inequality President Obama said this summer Too many Americans are working long days for less pay than they deserve he told the nation June Hearing all the complaints about how the richest Americans from hedge fund managers to public company CEOs have become lots richer while purchasing power has stagnated for millions Obama promised to strike back He ordered the Labor Department to raise the number of U S workers eligible for overtime The proposal would double the minimum yearly pay for which bosses can exempt most workers from overtime to Obama estimated this would mean a raise or at least more free time for five million American families Obama s goals were laudable Let s put more money into the pockets of people working very hard at the lower end of the salary range or make them hire more people if they don t want to pay overtime says John P Quirke a lawyer representing employers for the law firm McCarter English But Quirke says neither regulators nor most employers have done much to prepare for the psychological and emotional impact of reclassifying salaried professional and specialist staff as hourly workers who will have to start signing time sheets again such as when they were kids And who s to guarantee they will be paid more Broader changes This brings us to Vanguard Group This month I reported that the Malvern based mutual fund company had reclassified U S employees out of its global staff as hourly employees instead of salaried Vanguard spokeswoman Arianna Stefanoni Sherlock told me the change was due in part to the anticipated Department of Labor regulatory changes along with broader changes to our job classification structure Will these reclassified Vanguard employees earn more less or about the same The company wouldn t say then other than to promise its goal was to offer a pay and benefits package that is fair reasonable and competitive to all of our crew members whether they are hourly or salaried When I posted that answer dozens of Vanguard employees spouses and others wrote or called me privately to talk about what they see as the most obvious effect of the change Many employees who earn less than a year are losing year end bonuses worth a few thousand dollars without any guarantee they will make it up through overtime The job reclassification also offers smaller promotion pay increases than under the old system Some said they felt demoted and wanted to know why Some crew are puzzled why Vanguard after tripling its customer assets and vastly boosting its aggregate fee revenues since the recession without an increase in hiring needs to be so relentless in controlling labor costs Vanguard s low fees and cost controls are central to its marketing Is this greed by senior managers they asked Was the company trying to reduce expense ratios so it could avoid raising fund fees in case it is forced to pay higher federal income taxes pending an IRS review Others said Vanguard proud of its reputation for not doing mass layoffs might be invoking the Labor Department rules as part of a larger reclassification strategy that would have the effect of persuading longtime workers to leave so the company could more easily reduce head count or hire new people Information technology workers said the changes come as more work is being outsourced to providers such as India based TCS Tata Consulting Services Sherlock the Vanguard spokeswoman said These changes have nothing to do with speculation regarding attempts to reduce head count cover anticipated future tax costs or outsourcing The majority of IT work continues to be done internally at Vanguard She also said Overtime requests will be determined as needed We believe there will be opportunity for overtime particularly during high volume times for the business One of few Quirke praised Vanguard as one of the few U S companies that has started talking about the Labor Department rules in any form before their scheduled implementation early next year the government could still change details such as the overtime pay threshold Better to communicate now than make abrupt changes when the rules are final which could leave workers hurt or suspicious he said It shouldn t be surprising if companies use Obama s initiative to overhaul pay policies Quirke added If there s one positive thing to come out of this regardless of what side of the fence you are on it gives companies an opportunity to revisit where their priorities are and how they are going to compensate individuals to advance those priorities Quirke told me Of course that may end up hurting some people JoeD phillynews com PhillyJoeD www inquirer com phillydeals

this week s Meeting of the International Microelectronics Assembly and Packaging Society IMAPS imec and CMST imec s associated lab at Ghent University present a novel technology for thermoplastically deformable electronics enabling low cost D free form rigid electronic objects The technology is under evaluation in Philips LED lamp carriers a downlight luminaire and a omnidirectional lightsource to demonstrate the potential of this technology in innovative lighting applications Thanks to its energy efficiency excellent light quality and high output power light emitting diode LED technology is becoming the sustainable light source for the st century But in addition it also allows to design unprecedented innovative lighting solutions Imec and CMST s new thermoplastically deformable electronic circuits now add a new dimension to the possibilities to fabricate novel lamp designs as well as smart applications in ambient intelligence and wearables The innovative technology is based on meander shaped interconnects a robust technique to realize dynamically stretchable elastic electronic circuits including LEDs These are then embedded in thermoplastic polymers e g polycarbonate Following production on a flat substrate using standard printed circuit board production equipment the circuit is given its final form using thermoforming techniques such as vacuum forming high pressure forming or even injection molding Upon cooling the thermoplastic retains its shape without inducing large internal stresses in the circuits The method based on standard available production processes does not require large investments reducing the cost of fabrication The resulting designs have a low weight and low complexity a high resilience a low tooling and material cost and a higher degree of manufacturer independence due to the standard industrial practices that are used The production process was developed in collaboration between the industrial and academic partners involved

Is the revised A already obsolete By Adam Mazmanian Oct The federal government s IT policy rules are getting their first overhaul since Proposed revisions to the Office of Management and Budget s Circular A the document governing the management and acquisition of federal information resources take into account new law and the heightened level of cybersecurity risk facing government systems But the document is noticeably quiet on some more recent policy shifts that were designed to make federal IT deployment more agile and more open Noah Kunin director of delivery architecture and infrastructure services at the General Services Administration s F pointed out the disconnect in comments on GitHub where the proposed revisions are posted It s still very confusing what A is trying to actually do Kunin wrote The current draft of A is still failing to strike the right balance between specificity and abstraction He said the revised document fails to absorb the recent innovations in IT policy that grew out of the failure of HealthCare gov which include the creation of F the U S Digital Service and guidelines for successful IT acquisition design and deployment The vast majority of the new A reads like what we should have sent out with little fanfare in not Kunin wrote Specifically the new A does not make recommendations for the use of agile development methodologies nor does it advocate the use of open source software And it doesn t incorporate the reforms backed by the Digital Services Playbook and TechFAR documents By not placing the Playbook in what I call the official federal compliance architecture of which most documents trace back to A and or a statute the possibility for meaningful enforcement or acceleration of the Playbook s precepts are removed Kunin wrote On cybersecurity he added that the revised A effectively maintains the current policy framework without any notable policy change the same framework that s allowed for the most catastrophic set of digital security failures ever seen by the U S government The security recommendations in the revised A which include multifactor authentication and encryption of data in transit and at rest are either watered down or saddled with requirements that are likely to make implementation difficult Kunin said He plans to drill down into some specific issues in GitHub pull requests However time is short for a transformative rewrite of A OMB has already received feedback from other agencies and the window for public comments will close on Nov About the Author Adam Mazmanian is FCW s executive editor Connect with him on Twitter thisismaz

Some people and hundreds of vendors gathered in Las Vegas this week for the HR Technology conference a show where companies like Workday and Oracle show off their big enterprise systems and commune with clients It s also where if you look hard enough you ll get a glimpse of the innovations that could soon define the way we work Right now the future is one where workers have more information on everything from the hiring process to day to day management And start up founders are selling bosses tools to empower employees by letting them weigh in often anonymously on company policies their managers and the everyday practices that drive them crazy As companies struggle to find qualified workers employee satisfaction is a lightning rod right now and they are looking for software to help them diagnose and address problems faster and smarter says George LaRocque a human resources technology consultant Companies are trying to understand why and where workers are not engaged and then fix that he said As HR analysts like to say in times like these the war for talent is over and the talent won Conference organisers singled out one company trying to improve the perennially opaque process of applying for jobs Great Hires a candidate experience company out of Oakland Calif tries to level elements of the playing field between job candidates and employers with a Web based tool that gives applicants information about who will interview them with links to relevant bios blogs and social media feeds Great Hires also provides company information such as annual reports and employee testimonials and prods candidates to submit feedback about the interview process The features nod to the fact that hiring is a two way decision these days Employees want to have a voice says Arnaud Grunwald co founder of Hyphen a start up that sells itself as an internal version of Glassdoor a site that crowdsources workers reviews of companies The mobile only app gives employers a chance to listen in on anonymous conversations among employees to find out how they really feel In exchange employers must offer an open nearly no holds barred network the app bans words and lets users flag and take down posts Hyphen is founded on a few tenets said Mr Grunwald The network must be employee driven anonymous and mobile only It is similar to apps like Memo which let workers post anonymous information about their employers except that each Hyphen network is sponsored by the employer and open only to its employees Posts from executives are tagged as official so employees know when a question or response is coming from managers The system alerts administrators or managers to a thread when something is flagged as inappropriate or when a certain threshold of employees has commented read or liked a post It s unclear whether large employers really want to hear workers unvarnished opinions though A lot of companies aren t ready for that level of transparency said Josh Bersin head of HR consultancy Bersin by Deloitte And companies fear that anonymous feedback tools could be poisonous for workplace morale an issue raised in a recent New York Times article about Amazon com s corporate culture Some companies are looking for more passive ways to collect information about workers feelings An approach called sentiment analysis allows companies like International Business Machines and Intel to mine free text from sources such as blog posts and open ended survey answers to divine how employees feel without asking them directly Kanjoya a small San Francisco company selling that method to Intel among others generated buzz at the conference and was tapped by organisers as one of a half dozen HR technology start ups to watch along with Great Hires Wall Street Journal

Federal officials who oversee cybersecurity on Wednesday listed four cyberthreats that keep them up at night in an appearance before a congressional panel on Wednesday The question was posed by Rep Jackie Speier D Calif for Admiral Mike Rogers commander of U S Cyber Command and head of the National Security Agency and Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work Rogers There are three things in cyber that concern me Are we going to see offensive activity taken against U S critical infrastructure Are we going to see the focus shift from the theft of intellectual property the theft of information to manipulation of the data that s in our system so we no longer can trust what we see And the third thing that worries me is are we going to see non state actors read terrorist groups start to use the web as an offensive weapon Work W e have a large number of systems that were built in an era the systems were not built to withstand the cyber environment that we re in now So what keeps me up at night is can we get through all of our systems and make sure that they do have cyber hardening Going forward we re making sure that there are key performance parameters in every system we have but we have to go through this risk mitigation on every one of our systems and say what is the critical cyber vulnerability have we taken care of it More from the Washington Examiner Rubio predicts Russia is one of several U S adversaries who tried to hack Clinton s server I don t know this for sure but I bet you re going to find the Chinese as well By Gabby Morrongiello AM Work also echoed Rogers statement that the manipulation of data really keeps me up at night Critical agencies across the federal government have been hacked by China and Russia including the White House the State Department the Department of Defense and the Office of Personnel Management To date the hacks have resulted in the theft or exfiltration of information Officials have worried those hacks could eventually evolve such that perpetrators begin to manipulate information instead of stealing it and that government data some of it classified will become untrustworthy Malicious attacks which are more likely to come from non state actors such as terrorist groups would be more likely to target critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants transit systems or consumable water supplies Top 
By Independent Comment on this story Instagram is the place where people go to share their selfies and holiday snaps and to sift through the photographic evidence of everyone else s fabulous life Not an Instagrammer Well you re missing out on a social network that s stuffed full of artily shot camera phone photos that broadly fall into the following categories there are the pictures of people s bronzed limbs laid out in front of them on sunloungers aka hot dog legs yoga poses in front of waterfalls lakes seashores muscled gym bunnies demonstrating military grade stomach crunches improbably coloured sunsets superfruit smoothies made with non dairy soya avocado on toast and CGI perfect make up tutorials While no doubt some people find these things inspirational a backlash has always been building Fed up with this digital display of perfect people having perfect lives on perfect holidays with perfect children a new breed of Instagrammers is coming clean One couple has admitted their gap year posts would have been more accurate with images of all the toilets they ve cleaned and beds they ve made while another photographer is revealing what comes outside the frame of Instagram shots often filthy flats crappy balconies and far from perfect skylines Teenagers meanwhile have come up with a smart way to juggle the pressures of looking on point on Instagram while keeping things real IOL Tech The psychology of envy and Fomo fear of missing out is fanned by the flames of Instagram as research by Andrew Przybylski from Oxford University s Internet Institute has shown He found that Instagram makes users feel per cent worse about their lives than other social media networks Can being more honest on Instagram save us from ourselves Let s be frank quitting your job to travel the world is not an unusual dream for the average desk bound commuter Who wouldn t rather wake up to the sound of the Indian Ocean instead of the Today programme And those who do go for it and take a grown up gap year are much envied by those of us worrying about paying off this summer s days in Cornwall Instagram comes in very handy here as a couple from South Africa Stevo Dirnberger and Chanel Cartell knew only too well when they set off on a travelling adventure back in March Since then they have attracted Instagram followers to their howfarfromhome account fans who comment like and regram share when the couple post pictures of rushing waterfalls in Sweden snow sprinkled Austrian Alps and mesmerisingly blue seas across Europe But after six months of travelling they ve confessed what their trip really looks like without the filters I feel it necessary we share the uglier side of our trip wrote Cartell in a blogpost Browsing through our Instagram feed it seems like we re having the time of our lives Don t get me wrong we are But it s not all ice creams in the sun and pretty landscapes N So far I think we ve tallied toilets scrubbed kilos of cow dung spread two tons of rocks shovelled metres of pathways laid beds made and I cannot even remember how many wine glasses we ve polished But despite fessing up their Instagram feed still looks idyllic with nary a dirty bathroom or pile of animal dung in sight Teen Instagrammers have a solution choosing to share their real lives with a select few on confusingly named Finstagram accounts fake Instagram where they post unflattering photos videos and filter free images Their Rinstagram accounts real Instagram are where parent and peer friendly content goes It s an almost corporate way of running a social media feed In a post on Medium com earlier this year year old Eric Herber explained why he and his friends had developed this double life I have learnt that Instagram posts are an art It can take a lot of time for me to post a photo on Instagram I need to decide the photo to post ask friends for advice on captions make sure every blemish is not seen and edit it I along with other teens spend this time because we know that everyone will see it and it can define who you are he said Teens are now not just checking and maintaining one Instagram account a day they are consistently monitoring and updating two accounts their rinsta and their finsta one public and open for any acquaintances they may meet and one for just close friends Finsta gets rid of the stressful element of Instagram but in a familiar environment Dr Jane McCartney a chartered consultant psychologist says It s really interesting that people are looking at the bigger picture and realising that their Instagram images often aren t quite representative of what they had hoped There s a generation growing up who will never consider whether taking pictures of everything is or isn t something we should do all the time and for them it s a way of communicating Kim Kardashian has admitted she may take hundreds of selfies before choosing one to post That s not a bad thing for people to know The approach of the Thai photographer Chompoo Baritone is a welcome blast of clarity in this world of hot dog legs and handstands on clifftops Baritone has created a series of photographs in which Instagram shots are juxtaposed against a broader picture to highlight how easy it is to snap a tasty looking dinner in a stylish looking flat without revealing the chaos outside of the frame which in this case includes a cat on the table some half eaten instant noodles and an unappetising lump of rubbery fried egg In another brilliantly mischievous image a yogi is shown holding an enviably straight headstand with a background of lush green grass Outside of the shot She has a helping hand two actually gripped around her ankles to stop her from falling over It s also worth remembering that even if your feed is full of show offs using fauxtography a term used to describe the liberal use of filters cropping and effects on distinctly average snaps not everyone is trying to rub your nose in their photogenic lives When envy rears its head you can do one of three things type in the Boring hashtag to see who is having a duvet rather than a red letter day wonder at the pictures collected on boringinstagramphotos unappetising canteen meals being a speciality or get real and log off The Independent Related Stories

IBM Head in the cloud Feet on the ground The computational nitty gritty of Watson s modus operandi remains IBM s trade secret Watson lives in the cloud the computing industry s name for application software and data stored and run on company controlled machines remote from the user rather than on the user s own machine so it is unavailable to those who might wish to reverse engineer it But the principle behind it called cognitive computing by IBM is well known the crucial point being that the software involved can modify itself and thus learn as it goes along The process starts with Watson comparing a question it has been asked with a database of potential answers and generating a long list of possible responses from these It then scores the elements of this list against the contents of its numerous other databases be those encyclopedias medical files audio clips or images Fact checking algorithms moderate the process according to the perceived reliability of the sources and a most probably correct result or often a set of them pops out The final step is for human experts to rate and fine tune the results improving them and thus teaching the software what to do in an iterative process until the system has been trained well enough to be released to the world To this end IBM itself employs teams of linguists psychologists and sociologists as well as coders But it also encourages others to do likewise Rob High chief technology officer for the Watson project says the tools just announced will extend the range of things developers can do with Watson They will for instance permit the coding of apps that can understand questions in languages other than English that can carry on an apparently intelligent conversation a particular desideratum of AI engineers since it was set as a benchmark of success by Alan Turing an early computer scientist that can help people reach decisions about things like what sort of car to buy Mr High says IBM used Watson to select the location within San Francisco of its new cognitive computing headquarters and even that can assess the emotional state or personality traits of their interlocutor One early adopter of Watson Point of Care a firm in New Jersey provides doctors with iPad apps that summarise the latest peer reviewed research on specific diseases Earlier this year Point of Care s staff trained Watson to answer based on the most up to date information thousands of questions that doctors and nurses might ask about the symptoms and treatment of multiple sclerosis lung cancer and diabetes Sandeep Pulim the company s chief medical information officer says the training process for a particular condition takes about weeks After that the app can incorporate new research automatically as it is published Ross Intelligence in Toronto is doing something similar for lawyers They can pose to its Watson app obscure questions on bankruptcy and receive answers complete with citations and useful readings from legislation or case law And services for less specialised customers than doctors and lawyers are also starting up Wine me an iPhone app developed by VineSleuth in Houston Texas recommends bottles based on taste budget and accompanying food Go Moment in Santa Monica California uses Watson to power a virtual assistant called Ivy to help hotels automate their customer service UnitesUs an online employment agency based in Irvine California asks Watson to analyse candidates writing style such as their social media updates and tweets to gain insight into their personalities It sounds like seaside palmistry but the firm claims candidates get more interviews as a result IBM itself makes money from this by the simple expedient of charging firms for access to Watson according to a standard menu of fees Transcribing a minute of speech costs cents Help with a decision such as choosing a bottle of wine costs cents A personality analysis is cents A session training Watson with a large quantity of data will set a developer back Other AI systems are available IBM s rivals though usually limit their ambitions to one area of expertise Clarifai in New York tags pictures with keywords Metamind in Palo Alto California analyses tweets for brand names and positive or negative emotions Even Microsoft which launched a set of AI development tools earlier this year concentrates on detecting and identifying faces Watson however seems truly multipurpose IBM is even experimenting with using it to add cadence and intonation accompanied by appropriate non verbal gestures to the speech of a humanoid robot If it can pull that off a truly disturbing possibility looms that the next TV show featuring Watson might be America s Got Talent

Identification Control of Earwigs Eliminating this commonly encountered occasional invader from a structure requires a range of nonchemical control measures followed by the application of insecticides to specific active harborage sites Editor s Note In this excerpt from the th Edition of the Mallis Handbook of Pest Control which will be published later this year one of the industry s leading entomologists provides practical insights about how to identify and control a common occasional invader earwigs Many of us have asked the question What makes something an occasional invader If we define the term occasional invader would literally be something that a client does not want to see that would appear infrequently Whether or not it is a pest comes down to the definition If we define pest as an annoying or troublesome animal or thing then an occasional invader pest would be some type of animal including an insect or arthropod that appears randomly in their home or business Any person working in the pest management industry for any length of time will encounter some pest that falls into this group Such occasional pests can pose a difficult challenge to solve It should be noted that although the occasional insect may appear to be a minor pest to the pest management professional it can be a major pest to the client Moreover what is a common pest in one region of the country may be a rare or introduced pest in another area In the following article we ll examine one of the more common occasional invaders encountered by pest management professionals earwigs Fact vs Fiction Earwigs owe their name to the widespread superstition that they purposely crawl into the ears of sleeping people and bore into the brain According to Fulton the word earwig is derived from the Anglo Saxon earwicga meaning ear creature Despite the unusual folklore that surrounds this insect translations of the Latin names Dermaptera order and Forficulina suborder more accurately describe the morphology of this insect Dermaptera refers to the skin like forewings present in winged species and Forficulina translates to little scissors referring to the prominent forcep like cerci extending from the abdomen The cerci are used by the earwig as both defensive and offensive weapons and occasionally are used to capture prey Additionally the morphology of the cerci is quite variable and may be used as an aid in distinguishing between species as well as sexes The cerci of females are typically much straighter when compared with the strongly curved cerci of the male Earwigs are brownish to black in color narrow bodied elongate and somewhat flattened insects ranging inch to inch to mm in length Adults may be winged or wingless and they have chewing mouthparts The nymphs add antennal segments at each molt until reaching a total of segments as an adult The wings when present barely extend onto the abdomen with the tips of the folded membranous hind wings extending from under the forewings Upon cursory glance earwigs may resemble rove beetles Approximately worldwide species of earwigs have been described most occurring in tropical regions Arnett Twenty two species are found in the U S Borror et al General Biology Over the past several decades relatively little research has been conducted on life histories of the North American earwig species Earwigs undergo gradual metamorphosis and most species overwinter in the adult form Some species have glands from which they squirt a foul smelling yellowish brown liquid for defensive purposes According to Eisner the European earwig Forficula auricularia Linnaeus uses its cerci as a first line of defense and the secretions as its secondary defensive tactic Earwigs are active at night and hide during the day Being thigmotropic earwigs like cockroaches prefer to hide or rest in dark moist cracks such as those found under tree bark and beneath stones boards and debris The diet of earwigs is diverse and consists of a wide variety of plant and animal matter Earwigs feed on leaves flowers fruits and fungi as well as on aphids and larger insects such as flies captured with their pincer like cerci Earwigs are well known for their gregarious behavior which similar to cockroaches is driven by an aggregation pheromone Sauphanor Walker et al At least in the European earwig the aggregation behavior appears to be associated with contact between conspecific individuals and frass resulting in aggregations of several dozen to several hundred individuals Walker et al According to Sauphanor the aggregation pheromone is active in controlling the aggregation behavior of all nymphal instars as well as the adults of both sexes Maternal care is also exhibited among earwigs Females dig a burrow or earthen cell into which they deposit approximately to eggs Once this is complete the females gather the eggs and organize them into a pile The female tends to the eggs and guards the nest from all intruders including their mates Throughout the development of the embryo the female picks up each egg individually in her mouth and licks them The function of this licking behavior is still unknown It has been speculated that licking may prevent the growth of fungus on the surface of the egg Shepard et al stated that eggs not regularly cared for by the female are destroyed by fungal infections unless treated with a fungicide Upon hatching the young nymphs remain in the earthen chamber throughout the first instar and are provided with food gathered by the female Vancassel European Earwig European earwig adults are inch mm long dark reddish brown in color with a reddish head and characterized by pale yellowish brown legs Adult males have strikingly different sized forms polymorphs that have forceps of varying lengths and complexity of form with some individuals measuring up to inch mm long The female s cerci are slender and straight and have a slight inward curve toward the tip This cosmopolitan insect is believed to have been first observed in the United States in in Seattle but it is now found throughout much of the United States and parts of Canada Because large numbers commonly seek shelter inside and around building exteriors and homes the European earwig often becomes a household pest This earwig is an omnivorous feeder very fond of plants as food Because this earwig feeds on a variety of plants however the injury it causes to any particular plant is usually not serious Dimick and Mote upon examining the insects digestive tracts found the contents to be largely lichen and pollen When these insects feed on plants they make small irregular holes in the leaves and may even skeletonize them If it were not for an absence of slime their work could be mistaken for that of slugs The European earwig is disseminated largely through people s activities In this respect Crumb et al noted this earwig may be carried long distances in bundles of newspaper the luggage of travelers cut flowers packages and crates of merchandise lumber and shingles automobiles and even rarely in letters The earwig readily avails itself of any dark moist crevice such as those found in balled plants heaps of manure boards and similar locations Morgan noted that the adults will float in water for hours and then may resume immediate activity upon reaching a dry surface It is in this way they are distributed on debris floating in streams and rivers For a few decades following its North American introduction population explosions of the European earwig were common In more recent times populations of this earwig have stabilized in most of its geographical range and only occur in large populations when environmental conditions are favorable Life History Fulton and Crumb et al studied the life history of the European earwig in Oregon while Lamb and Wellington and Lamb reported on the life history of this earwig in British Columbia These authors reported that the adults are more commonly seen during the cooler months and hide beneath boards stones and similar ground cover during the day The adults mate in late summer and early fall before establishing subterranean nests Before the female oviposits she drives out her mate These males return to the surface and are commonly seen from mid February into April Most females will produce two broods the first containing to eggs although only one generation occurs in North America First brood eggs hatch in slightly more than days during the cool spring temperatures but eggs laid during warmer months take about days to hatch The female European earwig is well known for her maternal care for the young The mother frequently moves the eggs from one part of the cell to the other rolling and cleaning them in her mouth After hatching the nymphs go through two phases during growth nesting and free foraging After the first molt the female opens the nest and the more venturesome second instar nymphs seek food at night but return to their nest during the day The third and fourth nymphal instars leave the nest and begin a free foraging existence on the soil surface By mid to late June most of the first brood has left the nests and many females lay a second batch of eggs By August and September both broods have reached adulthood and pairing begins Control Strategies A great deal of the management efforts directed at earwig infestations involve nonchemical means followed by the application of insecticides to specific active harborages If the conditions supporting the infestation are not addressed complete relief from the infestation is not likely to be realized Physical Removal In larger infestations vacuums are useful for removing large numbers of earwigs found in harborages outdoors as well as indoors If items stored outside are infested with earwigs these items may be shaken to dislodge the insects which can then be removed by vacuuming Harborage Removal Unfortunately the habitat that is created and is desired by suburbanites featuring landscaping mulches ornamental rocks patio stones picnic furniture decks etc is also conducive to earwig populations The elimination of outdoor harborages used by earwigs such as piles of lumber bricks and other items is a key to long term control Elimination of heavy ground covering vegetation near buildings is recommended Tree and shrub limbs should be trimmed away from walls and the roof Gutters need to be kept clear of leaves and other debris Excess Moisture Moisture management is also highly important Good drainage and grading and proper direction of irrigation sprinklers minimizes moisture beside the foundation Early morning watering allows the vegetation to dry during the day rather than remain wet throughout the night Crawlspaces also may need vapor barriers fans or sump pumps to sufficiently reduce high humidity and water Modification of Exterior Lighting The striped earwig and sometimes the European earwig will be attracted to exterior lights so the use of sodium exterior lights or yellow bug light bulbs on the outside of buildings will greatly reduce the numbers of these earwigs attracted to a structure Exclusion Access into the structure can be reduced by caulking of cracks and crevices and the installation of weather stripping around windows and doors Foundation and attic vents should be equipped with tight fitting insect screens Traps Traps made of bamboo or rolled cardboard or newspaper take advantage of the earwig s propensity to crawl into cracks and crevices Traps should be placed out prior to dark and checked the following morning Earwigs that are trapped can be shaken into a pail of soapy water Grooved board traps set in shrubbery hedges and around trees as described by Morris have been used to effectively reduce European earwig populations Sticky monitoring traps can also be used to detect and monitor the distribution of earwigs inside Treatments The application of insecticides to control earwigs generally should be undertaken after or in combination with addressing the conditions contributing to the infestation The best results are achieved when treatments are directed at active harborages discovered during the inspection Historically baits used around the exterior of structures have played a major role in the control of earwigs Today few effective baits are available that are labeled for such use As a result control of earwigs using insecticides is largely accomplished through the use of perimeter treatments A wide variety of current insecticides list earwigs on the label both for interior and exterior use Residual water based formulations e g WP SC CS are the most appropriate formulations for perimeter treatments as well as to earwig harborages outdoors Dust formulations should be used to treat inside cracks holes and voids in the building s exterior where earwigs may be hiding and sealing these openings following treatment is recommended Use caution when sealing any openings to the structure Some openings such as weep holes are needed to maintain the health of the structure itself Special attention should be paid to the areas most frequented by earwigs In addition to building foundations piles of wood and stones wooden fences tree holes the underside of decks sheds landscape timbers and dog houses are likely harborages The European earwig s preference for cracks inside and out is similar to that of the German cockroach indoors therefore crack and crevice treatments are the primary treatment technique to

space she occupies in the world is an enigma She is so disabled that her mother considers her unabled At her brain is believed to function at the level of a newborn s She cannot speak cannot walk cannot see anything beyond light and dark and perhaps the shadowy shape of a face held inches away As her body grew bigger her parents feared her world would grow smaller How would they lift her or get her out of the house They saw for Charley a grim future of hoists and machinery of isolation and loneliness of days spent trapped in bed staring up at a ceiling she couldn t even see So Jenn and Mark Hooper came up with a radical solution They gave their daughter hormones to stop her growth Then they had doctors remove her womb to spare her the pain of menstruation Charley is now around meters tall foot and kilograms pounds and will remain so for the rest of her life The Hoopers fight to get the hormone treatment known as growth attenuation was grueling Although an increasing number of parents across the U S Europe and New Zealand consider it a medical miracle others see the very idea of stunting and sterilizing the disabled as a violation of human rights A doctor once told Jenn he would never do such a thing to his child Well aren t you lucky Jenn replied that you never had to make that choice To hold Charley is to experience the sensation of dead weight She is a jumble of uncontrolled limbs with a floppy head that needs supporting Her knees are often locked and her legs held stick straight Her wide brown eyes roam around not focusing but occasionally moving toward the source of an interesting noise Her parents try to interpret what she feels by the pitch and volume of her moans and whether her freckled face is slack smiling or contorted in a gaping yawn when she suffers through intense muscle contractions Here in Bali their annual retreat from the bleak winters back home in New Zealand the warm sun illuminating her olive skin can trigger what looks like a smile Everything about Charley is a guess Mark and Jenn dress her in purple because they imagine she would like it At Christmas they have no idea what to give her but buy her the same number of toys as her little brother Zak to avoid his questions about Santa s fairness They had wanted a baby so badly for so long The former high school sweethearts had always assumed they d have children They married in and began trying to get pregnant right away But when years passed and no babies came they headed overseas in search of other adventures For years they lived in the UK working in pubs and driving forklifts to fund their travels through Europe and Africa After returning home to New Zealand s North Island they began trying again for a baby and were on the verge of attempting in vitro fertilization when Jenn took a pregnancy test on Christmas Day It was positive Charley came into the world floppy and not breathing Midwives bungled their attempts to resuscitate her and by the time specialists arrived she had been deprived of adequate oxygen for nearly an hour Her brain was left irreversibly damaged The first few months were misery Charley screamed around the clock They waited for that moment parents rhapsodize about when your baby first looks into your eyes But Charley s eyes rolled aimlessly in their sockets After five months doctors delivered the diagnosis Infantile spasms a severe form of epilepsy The chances of her ever walking or talking were virtually nil And she was blind Charley suffered constant seizures and vomited everything up Cerebral palsy weakened her throat muscles making every swallow potentially lethal Jenn and Mark barely slept checking her throughout the night to ensure she hadn t choked to death There were dark moments when they wondered whether it might be better for her if she did die Valium helped quiet her screams And they found other ways to soothe her bouncing her on their knees giving her warm baths But eventually they knew she would be too big to hold or lift from the tub In a life of so few joys what then Jenn found an answer to their dilemma in a newspaper article about a severely disabled Seattle girl called Ashley This first case of growth attenuation on a disabled child popped up in a medical journal in Ashley s parents wanted her to remain small enough to participate in the family s activities as she grew up So doctors began giving her high doses of estrogen via skin patches pushing her body into early puberty accelerating the fusion of her bones and curtailing her height The most controversial part of the Ashley Treatment was the removal of her uterus and breast buds Her parents wanted to eliminate the pain of periods and the risk of pregnancy if she was ever abused along with the discomfort of breasts since she spent so much time lying down and strapped into wheelchairs Growth attenuation which refers only to the hormone treatment is in itself not new In the s and s doctors occasionally gave hormones to girls who were expected to grow very tall And the debate over Ashley s hysterectomy and breast bud removal was a familiar one given the early th century era of eugenics that saw tens of thousands of disabled people forcibly sterilized to prevent them from reproducing In the United Nations dubbed the sterilization of the disabled without their consent an increasingly global problem and last year the World Health Organization demanded an end to it What is newer is the idea of stunting disabled children to ostensibly improve their lives More and more doctors have received requests for the treatment A recent survey of the Pediatric Endocrine Society most of whose members are in the U S showed that of respondents have prescribed growth stunting hormones to at least one disabled child As more people do it it s less weird it s less freaky says Norman Fost a bioethicist who supports the practice There s comfort in numbers But it is by no means widely accepted Many doctors have refused to prescribe the treatment and those who do tend to do so quietly Gary Butler chairman of the European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology s clinical practice committee feels there is no need to stunt the growth of severely disabled children because they often enter puberty early which naturally leaves them smaller We would never ever resort to these invasive treatments Butler says It s completely unnecessary and I think it s important that one upholds the dignity and the rights of young people with a learning disability and physical disability The public too often reacts to the treatment with everything from unease to revulsion After all in many families growth is about so much more than size It is the bittersweet marker of the passage of childhood measured in the timeworn practice of pencil markings on a wall celebrated and mourned by visiting aunts and uncles who cry Look how big you ve gotten Growth is considered a given People are really entitled to grow and to become the people they were meant to be says Margaret Nygren CEO of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Would you ever want this kind of treatment done to you without your consent or knowledge And if the answer is no then why would one want to do that to someone else Yet for Charley s parents that question is moot because they have never been able to ask for her consent on anything They have always had to imagine the person who exists inside her broken body and what that person would want Like most parents they believe their daughter would want an extraordinary life So in many ways it comes down to this What makes a life worth living and what is a life worth To Jenn a person s life is a collection of experiences stories and memories Charley can t make those for herself so her parents wanted to make them for her from taking her sledding to traveling the world But that meant keeping her small enough to go along for the ride The choice they made for Charley they say was a choice made out of love We haven t stopped her doing anything Growing would have stopped her doing things Jenn says We didn t take away any choices that weren t already taken from her Growth attenuation had never been performed on a disabled child in New Zealand but the potential for a fight hardly dissuaded Jenn Tough self assured and admittedly stubborn she does not respond well to no There is a fury behind Jenn s drive Her words are often brittle sometimes brutal when she talks about the fate that befell her daughter She acknowledges she will likely be angry for the rest of her life But anger she says can be one hell of a motivator They approached Paul Hofman a pediatric endocrinologist at Starship Children s Hospital in Auckland New Zealand At first he didn t like the idea The whole process of making a child permanently into an infant and a small child seemed wrong to me he remembers today It took just one meeting to change his mind He could see the Hoopers wanted to give their daughter a good life and in the end he felt growth attenuation would help her What I thought was better for her was to have a functioning family that worked well he says I accepted Jenn s argument very very logical that being smaller was more sensible Hofman explained the possible risks High blood pressure blood clots stroke Then he sought an opinion from an Auckland ethics panel They dismissed the treatment as unnecessary There are well developed ways to manage severely disabled people in New Zealand and to assist family members the panel wrote To consider alternatives raises the concern that these are less than ideal Jenn was livid Those well developed ways were hardly ideal Few public places have equipment to move disabled people in and out of wheelchairs They already had to change Charley s diapers in the car or across the seats in a plane What would they do when she was fully grown So she proposed a compromise What if she got the estrogen patches from a doctor overseas and started the treatment outside New Zealand Could a local doctor continue the treatment once they returned home The panel agreed If Charley was already receiving a medication local doctors should continue to treat her for safety reasons It was the break the Hoopers had been waiting for Soon Jenn Mark Zak and year old Charley were on a plane to South Korea where Jenn had found a doctor willing to give them the hormones Within days the Hoopers say they noticed changes Her seizures stopped She began smiling Her stiff limbs became more pliable Hofman says that may be because estrogen changes neurological activity and can relax muscles After six months her breast tissue began growing then flattened At she began having breakthrough bleeding similar to what a woman can experience on birth control pills Concerned that Charley would have severe period pain like Jenn the Hoopers discussed a hysterectomy with her gynecologist She would never be able to consent to sex they reasoned let alone to pregnancy The ethics board approved the hysterectomy Charley was when doctors removed her uterus I knew it was the right thing to do but it was hard Jenn says There was sort of a finality to it It took nearly four years before Charley stopped growing Jenn sits next to her daughter whose body lies immobile near the pool She tickles Charley s nose with one of her braids and brushes the bangs from her eyes Jenn has spent years searching those eyes for some flicker of recognition A few times Charley has locked gazes for a fraction of a second a precious connection but one Jenn doubts her daughter noticed She has never bonded with Charley the way Mark has To Mark Charley is his daughter To Jenn she is more like a patient That s largely because she has spent so much time focused on Charley s survival She loves her but in a slightly detached sense the way an aunt might love a niece Some mornings in the hazy seconds after waking Jenn hears a child s footsteps outside her room It is always Zak but in her half conscious state there s a magical moment when she wonders if it s Charley She and Mark still get up throughout the night to ensure Charley is breathing Mark eventually quit his job as an architectural draftsman to help Jenn with the kids They get by on a government funded insurance program that supports at home caregivers and sales of a torso support wrap Jenn designed for disabled children Jenn has concluded that Charley has no idea she is her mother Mark believes she recognizes them at least he likes to think she does Don t you he murmurs pressing his nose against hers This is perhaps the biggest issue brought up by those who oppose growth attenuation How does anyone know what goes on in a profoundly disabled person s mind Sue Swenson raised a son who was quadriplegic autistic and couldn t speak He grew to meters feet tall and kilograms pounds before dying at age He had a good life she says and still took part in family activities when fully grown Swenson made medical decisions for her son all the time But to her growth attenuation is not just another treatment it is a mutilation She wanted her son to grow up and be the same size as his peers She wanted him to fit in Even if they can t speak how do we know what their experience is Swenson asks What if they re aware that they ve been made different The question of Charley s mind is the one that pierces through Jenn s wall of anger to reveal the anguish underneath Because while she is certain she is right that Charley is unaware of what has happened to her and that she will never improve she so wants to be wrong I would be the happiest person in the world to have her come to me Jenn says the words catching in her throat as tears begin to run down her face If I m totally wrong and she can walk tomorrow I haven t changed her potential And she does see potential in her daughter even if her daughter can t see it in herself Even if her daughter can t see at all Jenn sees people gain perspective just by meeting Charley She sees other disabled children benefit from the support wrap she designed for Charley She sees women helped by the advocacy group she launched to improve maternity care after Charley s botched birth Life isn t about being successful it s about being significant And she s certainly significant Jenn says So many others aren t because they re never seen We make sure she is In the first weeks of Charley s life Jenn found herself wanting an out So she made a deal with Mark She would give Charley her best two years as a mother But if their daughter hadn t improved by then they would consider giving her up It never came up again Today she can t imagine their world without Charley When the family gathers to watch Survivor at night Charley sits with them When Mark Jenn and Zak splash around in the pool Charley lies a few feet away When Jenn rocks her infant son Cody she murmurs in his ear See your sister When Charley was she almost died from a chest infection Jenn began to wonder what they would say at her funeral they couldn t talk about her laughter or her favorite games So they wrote up a bucket list for Charley with experiences they imagined a little girl would enjoy and spend their days trying to accomplish as many as they can Still to do Go down a water slide be a flower girl meet the Queen Would Charley actually like those things They don t know But they believe she d prefer checking items off the list to being stuck at home Though Mark and Jenn don t believe she has any concept of her mortality they try not to talk about it in front of her out of respect We don t expect her to live forever We don t want her to live forever Who wants this life forever Jenn says So we give her the best life we can while we ve got her From the radio attached to Charley s stroller Kesha begins to belt out Die Young Mark lifts his daughter s arm in the air and waves it back and forth to the beat He hums along to the chorus So while you re here in my arms let s make the most of the night like we re gonna die young Charley lets out a small moan Her father lets go of her arm It drops back into place at her side

Ohio cases highlight online targeting sextortion of teens By DAN SEWELLAssociated Press CINCINNATI AP Three federal cyberstalking cases that surfaced within a few days of each other in the Cincinnati area have underscored widening challenges in protecting susceptible youths from wily predators The three men are all charged with pressuring multiple girls or young women into providing sexually explicit images and threatening them with vengeful acts if they didn t comply FBI Director James Comey in a visit this month to the bureau s southern Ohio field office said parents who wouldn t allow their children to wander a mall or city at night without knowing who they were with should realize the online threats they face You let them on the Internet and they re wandering the world he said There are a lot of bad sick people out there FBI spokesman Todd Lindgren in Cincinnati said the three cases this month came to light at around the same time because of unrelated reasons and weren t part of a short term targeted effort The FBI s Child Exploitation Task Force works on similar cases involving children every day and the number of such cases appears to be growing nationally he said A survey Pew Research Center study found that more than half of women ages said they suffered some kind of online harassment like being called offensive names while a quarter reported they had been stalked online Sextortion cases like the ones that resulted in charges this month are facilitated by the spread of smartphones and social media said an educational outreach expert for Cincinnati Bell Stephen Smith said younger girls can be particularly vulnerable to older online predators They have an unfair advantage they re adults they can be patient said Smith who speaks at schools and other interested groups around Ohio Kentucky and Indiana If you have someone who has a strategy they can troll through the Web Smith said predators can watch social media posts to gauge a youth s state of mind self esteem issues and longing for a friend or a relationship He said predators even share tips and methods with each other online Smith said parents are often naive about the threats and face a daunting task because of the constant emergence of newer digital communication methods such as Snapchat Kik and online dating applications there are even apps to hide apps he said He urges parents to know their children s digital passwords and to keep up on digital technology Summaries of the three cases that resulted in federal charges this month The FBI said Nicholas Kurtz of suburban Clearcreek Township used Skype Instagram and other means to coerce teen girls in five states into exposing themselves to him online including one whom he persuaded to mutilate herself and act as his slave The FBI said it began investigating Kurtz after a year old girl in Wisconsin told police he was threatening to rape and kill her if she didn t keep doing as he wanted The FBI said he also threatened her and other girls with sharing their nude photos online and made such claims for sympathy such as saying he had cancer or lived in foster care Kurtz pleaded not guilty to charges of coercion and enticement Authorities said Cody Lee Jackson contacted a year old girl on Facebook in February and arranged to have her brought to his Norwood apartment by taxi several times for sex while he was on electronic monitoring because of an abduction case The FBI said by March he was keeping her in his apartment restricting her movements and eventually impregnated her The FBI said Jackson fled before his scheduled August sentencing for interference with custody in the earlier case but allegedly reached out to the girl by cellphone after he left Ohio and threatened to kill her and her family if she didn t take sexually explicit photos of herself and send them to him on Facebook where he allegedly used his Facebook accounts to transfer the pornographic images Jackson was arrested this month in Salt Lake City Utah and faces multiple federal and state charges No attorney was listed for him in federal court records The FBI said Bryan Harris of suburban Blue Ash used Facebook and other social media to communicate with more than a dozen young women and underage girls seeking nude photos or meeting to have sex The FBI said Harris would sometimes use insults to pressure females to send him nude photos and later would threaten to post them online or tell their parents or police He pleaded not guilty to two counts of coercion and enticement After his case became public the FBI set up a telephone hotline for tips about other possible alleged victims Within about a week Lindgren said the tip line had received more than calls Cincinnati Bell s site for digital advice for families http awiredfamily org Contact the reporter at http www twitter com dansewell

Scott Falkner Apple has often been the subject of scorn as with every other major cellular and software platform producer when it comes to their terms of service and accusations of collecting information without their users knowledge Now however Apple seems to be safeguarding you and your information when it comes to your iPhone and iPad Last week Apple brought the proverbial hammer down on over applications available in the Apple App Store because those applications were found to pull personal data from their users phones for their own use According to Apple these apps weren t disclosing that they were taking and storing personal data from their users However the apps had managed to be approved for the App Store all while using private APIs Photo by Sean Gallup Getty Images The mobile security company SourceDNA was the first company to figure out that there was a problem with the selected applications in the Apple App Store SourceDNA noticed that selected apps were pulling data to their applications using the aforementioned private APIs when they were uploading their own product Searchlight to the App Store Once SourceDNA found a few apps that were secretly downloading personal information they did an extensive search and found more than violators in the Apple App Store From there they contacted Apple You might think that the apps that were found to be stealing personal information would be obscure and small but some of the apps listed as being banned from the Apple App Store are actually very popular The scary thing is that even though SourceDNA found apps that were stealing information in the Apple App Store they have stated that there may be many many more that have slipped through the cracks We re concerned other published apps may be using different but related approaches to hide their malicious behavior We re continuing to add new features to our engine to discover anomalous behavior in app code and find out if this is the case When SourceDNA contacted Apple about the malicious apps Apple responded immediately banning them from the Apple App Store and releasing the following statement We ve identified a group of apps that are using a third party advertising SDK developed by Youmi a mobile advertising provider that uses private APIs to gather private information such as user email addresses and device identifiers and route data to its company server This is a violation of our security and privacy guidelines The apps using Youmi s SDK have been removed from the App Store and any new apps submitted to the App Store using this SDK will be rejected We are working closely with developers to help them get updated versions of their apps that are safe for customers and in compliance with our guidelines back in the App Store quickly What s ironic about SourceDNA catching the bad apps in the Apple App Store is that SourceDNA specializes in helping app developers better their coding and points out security flaws Photo by Spencer Platt Getty Images It should be noted that the actual developers of each of the banned apps were ignorant to the existence of the code that was collecting personal data from their users It has been estimated that the banned apps were downloaded over a million times before Apple removed them from the app store Each individual app contained the Youmi SDK which possessed the data collecting feature and reports indicated that the vast majority of them were produced by programmers based in China Now that the apps have been removed from the Apple App store most if not all of them will return very soon after their developers modify them so that they are not in violation of Apple s guidelines Photo by Stephen Lam Getty Images

A nanofiber hydrogel infused with snake venom may be the best material to stop bleeding quickly according to Rice University scientists The hydrogel called SB incorporates batroxobin a venom produced by two species of South American pit viper It can be injected as a liquid and quickly turns into a gel that conforms to the site of a wound keeping it closed and promotes clotting within seconds Rice chemist Jeffrey Hartgerink lead author Vivek Kumar and their colleagues reported their discovery in the American Chemical Society journal ACS Biomaterials Science and Engineering The hydrogel may be most useful for surgeries particularly for patients who take anti coagulant drugs to thin their blood It s interesting that you can take something so deadly and turn it into something that has the potential to save lives Hartgerink said Rice University researchers Jeffrey Hartgerink left and Vivek Kumar led research that combines a derivative of snake venom with their nanofiber hydrogel to help encourage blood clotting in wounds even for patients who take anti coagulant medications Credit Jeff Fitlow Rice University Batroxobin was recognized for its properties as a coagulant a substance that encourages blood to clot in It has been used in various therapies as a way to remove excess fibrin proteins from the blood to treat thrombosis and as a topical hemostat It has also been used as a diagnostic tool to determine blood clotting time in the presence of heparin an anti coagulant drug From a clinical perspective that s far and away the most important issue here Hartgerink said There s a lot of different things that can trigger blood coagulation but when you re on heparin most of them don t work or they work slowly or poorly That obviously causes problems if you re bleeding Heparin blocks the function of thrombin an enzyme that begins a cascade of reactions that lead to the clotting of blood he said Batroxobin is also an enzyme with similar function to thrombin but its function is not blocked by heparin This is important because surgical bleeding in patients taking heparin can be a serious problem The use of batroxobin allows us to get around this problem because it can immediately start the clotting process regardless of whether heparin is there or not The batroxobin combined with the Rice lab s hydrogels isn t taken directly from snakes Hartgerink said The substance used for medicine is produced by genetically modified bacteria and then purified avoiding the risk of other contaminant toxins The Brazilian lancehead is one of several South American pit vipers that produce venom that has proven to be a powerful blood coagulant Scientists at Rice University have combined a derivative of the venom with their injectable hydrogels to create a material that can quickly stop bleeding and protect wounds even in patients who take anti coagulant medications Credit Greg Hume via Wikipedia The Rice researchers combined batroxobin with their synthetic self assembling nanofibers which can be loaded into a syringe and injected at the site of a wound where they reassemble themselves into a gel Tests showed the new material stopped a wound from bleeding in as little as six seconds and further prodding of the wound minutes later did not reopen it The researchers also tested several other options the hydrogel without batroxobin the batroxobin without the hydrogel a current clinical hemostat known as GelFoam and an alternative self assembling hemostat known as Puramatrix and found that none were as effective especially in the presence of anti coagulants The new work builds upon the Rice lab s extensive development of injectable hydrogel scaffolds that help wounds heal and grow natural tissue The synthetic scaffolds are built from the peptide sequences to mimic natural processes To be clear we did not discover nor do any of the initial investigations of batroxobin Hartgerink said Its properties have been well known for many decades What we did was combine it with the hydrogel we ve been working on for a long time We think SB has great potential to stop surgical bleeding particularly in difficult cases in which the patient is taking heparin or other anti coagulants he said SB takes the powerful clotting ability of this snake venom and makes it far more effective by delivering it in an easily localized hydrogel that prevents possible unwanted systemic effects from using batroxobin alone SB will require FDA approval before clinical use Hartgerink said While batroxobin is already approved the Rice lab s hydrogel has not yet won approval a process he expects will take several more years of testing

A series of online attacks in the past year has spurred Japan and South Korea to bolster their cyber defenses improving their ranking on a yearly list of cyber maturity Australia was one of the main decliners South Korea last year faced a barrage of cyber attacks with many thought to originate in North Korea while Japan passed legislation putting its National Information Security Center in charge of cybersecurity after hacks on targets including the nation s space agency and its largest defense contractor South Korea and Japan have a different threat environment to Australia s said Tobias Feakin director of the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute which compiled the ranking It has only taken them a year to write policies implement them and smash down barriers in between departments Japan climbed to second in the ranking from fifth last year while South Korea rose to third from fourth Australia fell to fifth from third as Japan South Korea and Singapore improved at a faster rate The U S which is included because of its Asia Pacific exposure ranked first The ranking takes into account governance structures financial cyber crime enforcement military applications digital economy and business and social engagement Maturity is demonstrated by the presence implementation and operation of cyber related policies legislation and organizations said Feakin The following are summaries on the region s main countries with their scores Countries are rated in different categories on a score of to The full report can be seen here U S New Laws The U S delivers strong cyber policy through a sophisticated government structure and comprehensive legislative framework The establishment of new cyber laws has been relatively successful and the Obama administration has enacted several executive orders in relation to the regulation of cyberspace Japan Increased Authority The government has a comprehensive cross departmental approach to cyber policy Increased authority for government cyber agencies and the introduction of new laws reflect a continued and concerted rise in cyber maturity South Korea Strong Understanding South Korea demonstrates a strong understanding of cyber issues and efficient coordination of various agencies through an overarching policy The persistent threat from North Korea has resulted in a clear prioritization of cybersecurity issues and offensive capabilities both domestically and in South Korea s foreign engagement Singapore National Masterplan Singapore has continued to implement a coherent cyber policy aided by the National Cyber Security Masterplan The government has comprehensive legislation Internet regulation and a military network defense Australia Lacking Coherence Australia continues to improve on cyber maturity as evidenced by the opening of the Australian Cyber Security Centre in but there remains a paucity of coherent national cyber policy This will improve if the government delivers and effectively implements its promised cyber strategy Malaysia Social Awareness Dedicated cyber agencies and a more structured legislative framework have boosted Malaysia s cyber maturity It has moved beyond a purely technical view of cyberspace and now engages with international partners on policy and broadens its social awareness through the activities of universities and think tanks China Greater Clarity China has improved its cyber maturity by clarifying and centralizing the coordination of government cyber agencies and continuing to produce relevant legislation Cyber crime is actively but inconsistently addressed The country appears to have a deepened understanding of the cyber military threat but has failed to translate this into a tangible policy or program Vietnam Ad Hoc Vietnam has a modest government structure and legislative framework for addressing cyber issues The government is involved in international efforts to combat cyber crime but its ad hoc indications of interest in military applications suggest limited capabilities in that area India Policy Ambiguity While India has shown a strong awareness of cybersecurity issues policy ambiguity and inaction have left it without a fully implemented government strategy Thailand Additional Laws Thailand has a maturing cyber governance structure and is developing more legislation It would benefit from taking part in a more comprehensive debate that goes beyond capacity building to cybersecurity and governance Philippines Weak Enforcement The Philippines has diversified cyber legislation and dedicated cyber crime agencies but continues to suffer from weak enforcement Awareness of cyber military issues isn t translated into policies or capabilities Indonesia National Agency Indonesia has delivered on its promise of a National Cyber Agency a notable improvement in organizational structure and laws to address cyber crime are being developed But low government private sector interaction and insufficient telecoms infrastructure means Indonesia is failing to capitalize on the potential of its digital economy North Korea Mainly Military North Korea takes a highly structured and regulated approach to cyberspace but suffers from a lack of policy and cyber crime agencies The focus is mainly military and the government is suspected of having sophisticated offensive capabilities The regime s isolationism extends to its cyber policy it has no apparent international engagement on the issue Domestic computer and Internet access is very limited contributing to a low level of social and economic engagement on cyber issues

Deadline for train safety technology undercut by industry lobbying Resize Text By Ashley Halsey III and Michael Laris October at PM Follow ashleyhalsey rd Follow mikelaris Until a train barreled off the tracks at p m on May it had been business as usual on Capitol Hill Among the bills quietly making their way toward a final vote was one that would postpone by several years a multibillion dollar safety enhancement deadline facing the railroad industry A victory for the railroads which maintain one of the most powerful lobbying efforts in Washington seemed all but certain and likely to be little noticed outside of the industry But at that moment an Amtrak train hurtling toward New York City derailed in Philadelphia turning into a tangle of crushed metal that killed eight passengers and injured more Everyone including the railroad and federal investigators agreed that the catastrophe could have been prevented by a single innovation called Positive Train Control PTC It s an automatic braking system that federal regulators call the single most important rail safety development in more than a century Now after a period of reflection and several inquiries Congress once more is on the brink of postponing the deadline for use of PTC The proposed delay until at least comes in a new regulatory era for the railroads Trains filled with volatile natural gas or oil have derailed seven times so far this year and there is fear that one could cause catastrophic explosions as it passes through a city Positive train control or PTC is a safety feature that can override human error by slowing down or stopping a train automatically It was not in place at the Frankford junction where Amtrak Train derailed Edward Hamberger president and chief executive of the Association of American Railroads explains how PTC works and why the technology has not been installed broadly across the country Jason Aldag The Washington Post A mighty lobby What has taken place since May provides insight into the influence that effective lobbyists wield in Washington and how ready access to members of Congress has helped one industry fend off a costly safety mandate Seven years ago Congress ordered railroads to have PTC installed by the end of It was an uncomfortable deadline for the industry one it argued should be postponed PTC technology was too complex the railroads said and the billion cost to equip freight and commuter lines was prohibitive Federal economists put the cost benefit ratio at about to With their lobbyists in overdrive in the railroads might have persuaded Congress to delay the mandate But in the middle of that debate a head on train collision in California killed people and injured others The National Transportation Safety Board said PTC could have prevented the accident and that moved lawmakers to settle on the Dec deadline The NTSB says it has investigated rail accidents since that PTC could have prevented with a toll of people killed and people injured In the years since Congress moved to finalize the deadline in the railroad industry has spent million according to the Center for Responsive Politics CRP to maintain one of the most savvy lobbying teams in Washington It also contributed more than million during the same period to the reelection efforts of members of Congress targeting in particular the chairmen and members of key committees that govern its business In the chairman of the House subcommittee on railroads spoke out at a hearing denouncing the PTC mandate as an example of regulatory overreach He said PTC would have a very very small cost benefit ratio Since then that chairman Rep Bill Shuster R Pa has risen to lead the full House Transportation Committee Late last month he introduced a bipartisan bill to extend the PTC deadline to at least and beyond if the railroads demonstrate they are facing continued difficulties Railroads must implement this important but complicated safety technology in a responsible manner and we need to give them the necessary time to do so Shuster said in a statement announcing the bill Since taking office in Shuster has received campaign contributions of from the railroad industry according to the CRP with of it coming in the election cycle Money flows readily to the chairs of powerful committees but other members of the House Transportation Committee also have benefited from railroad contributions In the election cycle committee members received more than million in direct contributions to their campaigns As of the end of September the railroads had pitched another at the House committee members The Senate also has benefited from the railroad industry s largesse according to the CRP with senators receiving nearly million in campaign contributions in Outside the Beltway massive contributions may sound like the cost to buy a vote in Congress But in this era of mega money politics campaign contributions win something almost as valuable for railroad lobbyists face time with a member of the House or Senate They call and they get a member meeting right away said a senior Senate staff member familiar with the process They have a lot of access And that access brings into play what are described as some of the best lobbyists on Capitol Hill including several dozen who once were staff members or lawmakers in Congress Rep Peter A DeFazio Ore the ranking Democrat on the Transportation Committee and the recipient of more than in railroad campaign money since says it s the footwork of the lobbyists not the campaign contributions that wins the day In these days when you have one Wall Street billionaire spend a million bucks on a campaign getting a few thousand dollars from a railroad he said with a shrug The railroads invest a lot of time on the Hill and they present a pretty good story for the most part Oil boom raises the stakes Rail safety has never been a more pressing issue than it is today So far the people who have died in U S accidents that PTC could have prevented have generally been crew members or passengers That could change in dramatic catastrophic fashion The number of rail tank cars carrying flammable material in the United States has grown from seven years ago to last year thanks to the boom in domestic oil produced in the Bakken oil fields Those trains rumble from the oil fields in Montana North Dakota and Saskatchewan Canada to refineries on the East West and Gulf coasts This year seven trains have derailed either leaking their contents or exploding All of the U S explosions have come in remote rural areas where the erupting fireballs did little damage Canada was not so lucky In July a runaway freight train carrying tank cars full of Bakken oil derailed in the town of Lac M gantic setting off an inferno that destroyed downtown buildings and killed people Coastal states in the United States and the city of Chicago the most important railroad hub in the nation have come up with scenarios that depict the potential damage and death tolls should a train explode in different sections of their urban areas Chicago fearing that the plan s release could cause panic has declined to make it public Sarah Feinberg acting head of the Federal Railroad Administration says that worries of a train exploding in the middle of a city have caused her sleepless nights If PTC is not fully implemented by Jan we can and should expect there to be accidents in the months and years to follow that PTC could have prevented she told the House subcommittee on railroads in June Bob Gildersleeve Sr whose son Bob a Maryland father of two was killed in the May crash said rail companies seem to be evading the mandate with an attitude of What are you going to do about it Is a deadline a deadline Gildersleeve asked We re talking about fixing things that will eventually save lives and you guys haven t done it Why Many railroads far behind The railroads pitch for an extension both loudly in the media and quietly to Congress has been straightforward Unless the deadline is postponed Transportation of all goods over freight rail grinds to a halt the U S economy loses billion household incomes drop by billion Americans lose their jobs millions of commuters are stranded That was the message Oct when officials from three commuter rail lines and Association of American Railroads President Ed Hamberger held a conference call with reporters to add their voices to a chorus calling for an extension of the PTC deadline If the congressionally mandated deadline of Dec is not extended there will be a transportation crisis in the country with severe economic consequences said Michael Melaniphy president of the American Public Transportation Association The call had an unintended subtext all three of the commuter rail lines represented Virginia Railway Express Chicago s Metra system and California s San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission said their installation of PTC would be substantially complete by the end of Amtrak also promises to have PTC operating in the Northeast Corridor rails that it owns by the current deadline But most passenger trains operate on track that s owned by the freight railroads and the freight rail lines are far from ready to meet the deadline The freight companies say that without an extension all traffic on their lines must halt to comply with the law The railroads say they ve already spent billion on PTC installation and are committed to finishing the job None will meet the Dec deadline It doesn t matter how fast the bear is that s chasing you if you re running as fast as you can you can t run any faster said Frank Lonegro vice president of the freight rail carrier CSX which operates more than miles of rail in eastern states Washington and two Canadian provinces Some of the big railroads have made progress while others lag far behind One of the largest the BNSF Railway has made substantial progress At the other end of the spectrum Union Pacific hasn t fully equipped any of its locomotives according to a Federal Railroad Administration report released in August Union Pacific is pretending the deadline is not happening said one federal official who reviewed the report Union Pacific spokesman Aaron Hunt says that integrating these technologies into an interoperable system is very difficult much like merging medical records into a computerized system and that the company already has made a billion investment including work on the bulk of its locomotives Lonegro s colleague CSX spokesman Rob Doolittle said railroad lobbyists have been telling Congress for years that a deadline wasn t realistic In the early conversations before the law was passed the industry was identifying as a reasonable deadline that we thought we could achieve he said A federal official familiar with those negotiations offered a different perspective The railroads were in the room and Association of American Railroads and those guys were the ones who said was doable They did not embrace the deadline but they said it was a fair bill said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of involvement in the current negotiations It certainly wasn t Oh we sprung it on the railroads at the last minute as they would like some to believe said a staff member who was in the room while the deal was being struck When the final regulations were put in place nearly six years ago federal officials tallied up the expected benefits of having the automatic braking system in place The cost benefit analysis put a price tag on crumpled locomotives train delays track damage evacuation costs the cleanup of hazardous spills and other consequences of the crashes that could be prevented Government economists also sought to calculate the human costs in injuries and deaths using a figure of million for each life that was expected to be saved Over years there would be million in savings they figured or the equivalent of lives spared There would be another million in prevented injury costs In all they projected million in safety benefits from the PTC system It would cost billion over years including maintenance costs to net those benefits the economists calculated That came out to a cost benefit ratio of about to a disconnect seized on by railroad executives lobbyists and lawmakers sympathetic to their needs such as Rep John J Duncan Jr R Tenn Now everybody has tremendous sympathy for those families that lost loved ones in the Amtrak accident but my goodness now we re going to be spending billions to make something that already is one of the safest things in the entire world safer Duncan who has received in railroad campaign support during a year career in the House said at a June hearing And I m thinking that we would be better off to spend those billions in many many other ways cancer research and everything else But federal rail officials and some outside experts argue that the technology needed to prevent crashes ultimately can transform the future of railroading More frequent trains more efficiently deployed across the country could move more goods while cutting down on expensive fuel costs dramatically increasing potential benefits Some industry executives have embraced this future while others have pushed back In a conference call with Wall Street analysts just days before the Amtrak derailment

Comments I am an old movie nut I especially like old westerns I watched the movie Fort Apache the other night It stars John Wayne Henry Fonda and Shirley Temple to name a few I couldn t help but notice as I always do with all old westerns that the movie had hundreds of Indians but none of them were fat Why is that If you are a bowhunter you already know the answer Even today with ultra light compound bows lightning fast carbon arrows super sharp expanding broadheads camouflage scent eliminating clothing cover scents and hundreds of bowhunting gadgets designed to increase your odds killing a deer can be a pretty tough deal Wouldn t you hate to know whether or not you eat depended on your bowhunting success Incredibly the Native Americans did find success Nearly every Native American tribe including tribes in Alabama used some form of bow and arrow as a weapon for hunting Even though we think of the bows and arrows used by Alabama tribes as primitive think progressive technology They were much better than the bows and arrows used by the Native Americans years before them Bows as hunting weapons date to the Stone Age Some arrowheads discovered in America have been dated to be years old Arrowheads have been discovered among the bones of extinct animals such as the wooly mammoth Native Americans had thousands of years to improve the technology Like the bowhunters of today each generation of Native Americans improved on the archery technology that their forefathers used They learned to use stronger wood bows capable of shooting faster and longer distances They learned to wrap their bows with sinew to make them stronger They built faster and stronger arrow shafts and more streamlined broadheads eventually capable of shooting clear through a deer Just as today the deer s nose was a major obstacle to taking a deer with a bow and arrow in those days Native Americans eventually learned to cover their bodies in river mud to cover their scent Native Anericans shot bows and arrows to survive They had a lot of time to sit around and think about making their equipment better We tend to think of the longbows re curves and original compound bows that our grandfathers used as ancient technology I suspect the Native Americans felt the same way about the bows and arrows that their grandfathers used If you are a a bowhunter you spend a lot of hours in a tree thinking I think about the Native Americans on occasion and how they may have once hunted the same patch of land and what they had to hunt with and what I have to hunt with What they accomplished is downright impressive Mike Bolton is editor of Alabama Outdoor News He can be reached at aloutdoors aol com

reviews that Windows OS is getting and it is about time a smartphone gets its own version This is where the Lumia will be the pioneer model to be getting it once it gets released to the market next month Seems like the tide is now turning slightly in the favor of Microsoft against the mighty Android and Apple Now let s start with the appearance first The Galaxy A is actually the thinnest smartphone yet from Samsung With a body measurement of just x x mm x x in and weighing in at g oz and further complemented by its all metal design it is definitely a stunner Heads will turn when you brandish it in public But it is most likely you have to operate with two hands well unless you have a large enough hand that is As for the Lumia it will be wrapped in a polycarbonate body which will make it look outstanding With a body measurement of x x mm x x in and weighs g oz it sure is slim and lightweight In terms of look and feel you can t deny how good the Galaxy A looks The fact that it is also very thin makes for a supermodel kind of excitement It is like you are taking a huge celebrity out for a date Screen wise the Galaxy A is sporting a inch Full HD Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen that displays x pixels or ppi pixel density Then there s the Corning Gorilla Glass which adds more protection to this phablet Whereas on the Lumia it will be sporting a inch Quad HD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen that displays x pixels or ppi pixel density that simply is amazing There s also the ClearBlack display being used to ensure the best in terms of color reproduction To round it all off there s the Gorilla Glass for added protection The screen is scratch resistant and tough enough to let you relax and enjoy your time with the device If you are looking for and is comfortable with a huge screen device then look no further than the Galaxy A But if you are looking for something smaller then it does not get any better than the Lumia Truth be told the large metal body on the Galaxy A is great But does it have the necessary hardware to boot The answer is yes as we can find it equipped with the Qualcomm MSM Snapdragon chipset paired with an octa core with the combination of two separate quad core processors which is Quad core GHz Cortex A quad core GHz Cortex A Adreno graphics and GB RAM to top it all off There will be no issues whatsoever for you to run all the latest apps and games Although at the same time it would have been a little bit nicer with GB or GB RAM right No such worries on the performance of the Lumia though as there s the latest Qualcomm MSM Snapdragon chipset a Hexa core processor comprising of Dual core GHz Cortex A Quad core GHz Cortex A Adreno graphics and GB of RAM It sure does possess a lot of firepower and you can be assured of the best when it comes to performance Advertisement As for the camera department the Galaxy A is sporting Samsung s top of the line Megapixel primary camera which is currently being used in Galaxy S S Edge and Galaxy Note How lucky it is for the Galaxy A to have such honor Plus it is also sporting a Megapixel secondary camera which is being heavily touted by Samsung to be a great selfie device Camera is one thing that most Lumia devices are great at And on the Lumia you can be assured of the highest quality with its Megapixel primary camera that comes with Carl Zeiss optics and lets you take incredible pictures without having to adjust your settings It automatically takes sharper images of fast moving subjects and a triple LED natural flash helps create accurate lighting in darker environments Rich Capture lets you quickly adjust the color saturation level of bright or dark areas and add or remove the flash afterwards With higher resolution and a much improved fast action capture K video lets you preserve your precious memories in stunning quality Then there s the Optical Image Stabilization that comes with a virtually seamless auto focus this combination will let you take super sharp and silky smooth videos Storage wise you can find GB of internal storage plus an option to further expand to an additional GB via the microSD slot Anytime you run out of space pop it to your PC and transfer everything and start afresh By taking lots of high res photos and K videos you won t find any issues on the Lumia There should be enough storage capacity with it having GB of internal storage to which you can further expand up to a maximum of a whopping GB via its microSD slot Go ahead and take all the photos and videos to your heart s content In terms of battery the Galaxy A is powered by a non removable Li Ion mAh battery Quite frankly it should easily power up the device for at least a day As for the Lumia it is set to have a Li Ion mAh battery supplying juice to it This should also be sufficient enough for at least a day in between charging But it does have the added benefit of fast charging and wireless charging that you can tap into Now we ve come to the final stretch and it is a toss up between choosing Android or Microsoft OS On the Galaxy A there s the Android Lollipop which is quite common these days If it were to get an update to the latest Marshmallow then it should be great and extends its life for a few more months Now we come to the main selling point for the Lumia which is the Windows OS With Android coming out with Marshmallow and Apple with its iOS it is about time that Microsoft has a weapon up its sleeve It has released Windows for the desktop version and the Lumia will be its first device to be equipped with its mobile version So what it great about Windows then Office apps and Outlook Mail have familiar rich editing tools that scale to fit the screen you re using and the brand new Windows Store makes it easy to find apps music and videos And with Cortana for Windows you can use your PC to set a location based reminder that will arrive just in time on your Lumia Connect your Lumia to a Microsoft Display Dock and use it with an external monitor a keyboard and a mouse Office apps and Outlook scale up to create a big screen optimized work environment that makes you more productive It provides users with a PC like experience that is powered by your phone A quick and easy way to get the productivity benefits of a mouse and keyboard while leaving your laptop at work and relax knowing that you have a convenient way to get things done Finally there s the Windows Hello Beta which is an incredibly personal and secure way to unlock your Lumia Simply wake up your device look directly at the screen and the infra red camera technology automatically authenticates you We can only talk about it and as the saying goes seeing is believing Let s wait until its release before we can scrutinize it further But as far as things stand at he moment Windows on mobile is set to be a great proposition Advertisement With the Samsung Galaxy A it is already elevating the Galaxy A series even higher Coupled with the well known reputation that Samsung has it is selling like hot cakes If you are looking for a device that has a huge screen great hardware great camera and an extremely hot body then this is it for you But when you compare it against the Microsoft Lumia it seems like a different playing field altogether Things are already looking up with the impending release of Microsoft Lumia next month Excellent resolution excellent camera and the even more excellent brand new Windows OS accompanying it you can be sure of a whole new level of experience in the smartphone industry If that is still not able to convince you yet then perhaps the MP Carl Zeiss camera would Be prepared to take some of the best shots that a camera phone allows you to The Samsung Galaxy A is currently available for USD It is available in Pearl White Midnight Black and Champagne Gold The Microsoft Lumia is expected to be released sometime in November for an estimated price of USD And for the first time in recent months it will only be available in Black and White no vibrant colors like the previous Lumia iterations that we are so used to News From

reddit Just over six years ago when four major music labels were each agreeing to launch Spotify s streaming service in the U S and other markets they made a simple bet Spotify part of a new generation of unlimited streaming services would launch a premium subscription business alongside its free advertising supported product with a goal of converting free consumers to paid subscribers At the time the labels bet was actually forward looking and strategic especially as much of their core business had been ravaged by physical and digital piracy They could no longer fight the digital wave so they agreed to accede to streaming which looked like music s future Never mind that many of these new streaming subscribers weren t actually paying full freight or that many would come via mobile carrier subsidies or that labels had experimented unsuccessfully with this new freemium model in other markets The U S was and still is the most critical digital music market so the nod to launch was a true gamble Put simply the bet was that Spotify and its competitors could sign up enough paying subscribers to offset the amount of revenue the labels would lose from download stores like Apple s iTunes and Amazon Why would anyone buy a download again if they could stream it all for free went the doubters The logic went that once Spotify launched even mainstream music consumers would no longer need to buy downloads from Apple s iTunes or Amazon s stores And at least from the top line view the math was also simple consider the average number of tracks a consumer buys annually at cents apiece and compare that to the annualized revenue of a monthly subscription If Spotify and competitors were successful converting users to paying subscribers the labels would have actually grown their business Streaming wasn t the only bet rather than fight the eventual decline of their robust download business the labels also agreed to license a long list of new mobile products with their partners few of which they were credited for The list resembles an album of obscure tracks ring back tones in emerging markets like Latin America subsidized white label carrier backed music services that felt free to mobile subscribers video ring tones pre loaded artist handsets even complete music handset packages from Nokia and Sony that offered the same access to music Spotify did And while few focus on it the labels also intelligently invested in many of these new services including Spotify where the majors hold roughly percent of its equity This approach was actually an important sea change from past experiences like MTV which grew off the back of major label funded promotional videos to become a highly profitable television network The labels didn t share in the upside and MTV progressively played less and less music The MTV case is still regarded by many within the music industry as a model to avoid But as positive as the labels digital licensing strategy seems it may have actually been too liberal When one adds up all of the partnership activity and includes Internet radio which any webcaster can launch via a simple license from the U S Government there s a tremendous amount of music available to consumers free and premium Perhaps too much music consumption is at an all time high and while mid year results showed moderate revenue gains from U S streaming actual US subscriber growth is currently flat Digital music advertising sales are definitely not helping the picture and many U S consumers don t seem to see any big difference between interactive services and Pandora either They re just as happy to have music channels and playlists served up to them Perhaps most critical recent Nielsen research indicates that consumers don t really want to pay for music subscriptions at all Apple the biggest gorilla recently launched its own streaming service which appears to be an early stage mess initial reports on premium conversions from its three month free trials are not great and some suggest Apple s trials may actually be helping drive the growth of competitor Spotify s subscriptions Apple is still the biggest most critical digital partner for major labels and it still occupies a central place in their thinking and strategy While labels need to remain neutral and support all partners it is Apple who popularized and built the core of their commercial digital music business and they certainly need to support if not favor the growth of Apple Music So what can one expect to see from the labels in the face of all of this tough news It seems clear that the labels will move in some way to degrade the free streaming experience while trying to incentivize premium subscription growth This has been tried before in Europe and emerging markets but it is now more critical than ever Destructive options could include restricting certain content for free streaming or creating tiers of content only available to premium subscribers Limiting the hours or numbers of streams for free users could be considered and some even suggested extreme measures like forcing free consumers to buy a track or opt in to hearing a sponsor s message to keep that free music stream going too The labels could take a hard new look at usage liberties they allow partners such as the number of devices a consumer can use their subscription music with More constructive ideas consider the notion of labels offering niche content or packages of hits to partners who might sell at different price points a week streaming hits package or a specialized Jazz heavy metal or ethnic music package at month The concept of tiered pricing is not new Apple and the labels tried tiered download pricing six years ago too to marginal effect And the bigger idea of creating scarcity for music content isn t new either Vevo Sony and Universal s online video network was created around this notion with a goal of driving up video advertising pricing It s not clear how the labels will shake off the current subscription doldrums but with Apple and streaming subscription growth front and center you can bet they will do whatever it takes to build subscription sales their big bet And that just might entail giving free streaming a real haircut Follow Seth Schachner on Twitter www twitter com SethASchachner More

 cyber security Cyber attacks on Indian cos double in a year Such incidents in India have surged to thus far in the current financial year from reported cases in FY according to a report ET Bureau October AM IST Share MUMBAI In July two of the country s biggest banks started getting complaints that their customers were unable to access any online services An hour later it was discovered that professional cyber criminals had launched DDOS distributed denial of services attacks from servers traced to Pakistan In this case the banks were able to wrest back control of their servers using professional help without having to pay any ransom But they re not alone in becoming targets as Indian companies see growth many of them are facing increasingly coming to the attention of cyber attackers Such incidents in India have surged to thus far in the current financial year from reported cases in FY according to a report by PriceWaterhouscoopers PwC According to the report financial losses due to such attacks have risen in the past year Industry estimates put such losses at billion annually With rapidly growing interconnected business operations and increasing digitization the cyber security challenges will only grow and effective measures need to be taken to ensure protection against cyber attacks and threats said Sivarama Krishnan partner cyber security leader PwC India The motives for the attacks include economic advantage to espionage and even disruption and destruction of companies The attacks have become more sophisticated in the last few years which means defences also need to be better In the case of a Vadodara based listed company a phishing attempt originated in an email that came from an address similar to that of a client It sought payment for a consignment to be paid into a new bank account The phishing attacks are not random ones like earlier These criminals first map the target they exactly know what their likes are dislikes are and only then they are targeted said a senior police official Organisations in India are looking towards innovative cyber security solutions and we ve seen a growth in security budgets over the past few years that can support this trend Krishnan said Many Indian companies have also faced extortion demands from cyber criminals and at least two are said to have paid up in the last few months 
BERLIN AP Scientists say they have extracted ancient DNA from the skull of a man buried in the highlands of Ethiopia years ago that supports the theory that Eurasian farmers migrated into Africa some years ago This Stone Age resettlement had previously been theorized but the rare find allowed scientists to see what DNA looked like well before the time the migration would have taken place A comparison with modern populations around the world allowed them to see that the migrants left their genetic mark in the furthest corners of Africa This is the first ancient human genome found in Africa to have been sequenced said Marcos Gallego Llorente a geneticist at the University of Cambridge and member of the international team of researchers whose findings were published Thursday in the journal Science Previously scientists had only been able to sequence DNA from samples found in northern and arctic regions because the climate there allows genetic material to survive for longer In archaeologists with the help of local people discovered a cave containing the bones of a man dubbed Mota who died around BC and from whose temporal bone they managed to extract intact DNA By comparing this ancient DNA with modern samples researchers were able to map genetic changes that have taken place in the past years They found that East African populations now have as much as a quarter Eurasian ancestry while those in the far west and south of the continent still have at least percent of their genome from Eurasian migrants This paper is exciting because it is the first to get ancient DNA from Africa I think the analyses are also interesting in particular the claim that all sub Saharan Africans today have a substantial amount of ancestry from back to Africa migrations said David Reich a geneticist at the Harvard Medical School who wasn t involved in the study This is a fairly surprising claim but the analyses seem thorough The researchers traced this injection of genes to an event known as the Eurasian backflow It describes a period some years ago when people from the Near East and Anatolia streamed into the Horn of Africa a reverse migration to that which led the first humans out of Africa about years ago It is possible that there were even more ancient migrations back to Africa said Llorente but what we can say for sure is that there was a very big migration after the time Mota lived It was so big in fact that the number of migrants flooding into the Horn of Africa may have amounted to over a quarter of the population of the region at the time It s not clear why they moved though one theory that s been suggested is that farmers looking for fertile land traveled up the Nile Wheat and barley which first emerged in the Near East appeared as crops in East Africa around years ago Paul Heggarty a linguist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany who also wasn t involved in the study said the Eurasian backflow theory ties in with research about the spread of Semitic languages from the Near East to Ethiopia By analyzing the kinds of genes the Stone Age farmers carried to Africa the scientists also found they were closely related to the same population that had brought agriculture to Europe about years ago Today those ancient farmers closest genetic relatives are found on the island of Sardinia This means that modern day migrants from East Africa crossing the Mediterranean to Europe may encounter distant cousins whose ancestors took a different path than theirs thousands of years ago

Submitted by admin on PM Haowu cn NEW YORK Oct PRNewswire Chinese themed films videos and announcements dominated the many screens that overlook New York s Times Square on October st and nd an event that originally got its start when the Chinese government ran a series of short films promoting the country on the same screens in Sixty six Chinese firms decided to run short bilingual films in both Chinese and English promoting their brands on these same screens during the th anniversary of the founding of the People s Republic of China an event that has been celebrated in the country ever since on the first of October as National Day The Chinese companies have chosen the anniversary as a most appropriate day to showcase their strength and vision in global integration and service Times Square is a major commercial intersection and neighborhood in the heart of New York s Midtown Manhattan at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue Brightly adorned with massive outdoor screens and serving as the world s venue for competition between the top international brands Times Square is also known as the Crossroads of the World and a must see stop for any tourist visiting the city In the Chinese government ran a series of short films promoting the country during President Hu Jintao s state visit to the United States on the same screens in bringing a lot of attention to China from the four corners of the globe Themed Chinese brands expanding into international markets these promotional films were displayed on Thomson Reuters s large screens overlooking the square China is leading the world s headlines at the moment as a result of President Xi Jinping s just completed state visit to the United States and the Chinese companies immediately saw the opportunity to leverage the event as a way to accelerate their pace at globalization At the same time the Chinese brands collective show in Times Square timed to coincide with the th anniversary of the founding of the People s Republic worked to maximize the level of attention that was garnered Passers by on the streets below that were interviewed said that it was the first time ever to see so many Chinese companies showing up on the screens providing for them irrefutable evidence that China had succeeded in transforming itself from the world s factory floor to a country in the middle of building a coterie of strong brands that would soon become household names Chinese tourists and businessmen that happened to be passing through the square expressed amazement at the progress and development of the Chinese companies especially the effort put into building brand awareness Many clearly beamed with pride as they were interviewed Setting a record in the history of overseas promotional efforts by Chinese companies Since May when Sanjiu Medical Pharmaceutical Co Ltd became the first Chinese company to run promotions on the screens overlooking Times Square organizations and businesses in China began to use the unique advantages of the famous locale to show themselves to the world The premiere of a short promotional film entitled China People which was conceived and produced by the Information Office of the State Council on January served to push the trend to a new high The collective effort by the Chinese companies is the largest such effort to date setting a record in terms of what Chinese companies have done to promote themselves beyond the borders of their home country The organizer of the collective show explained that though the promotion system of invitation and organization for this effort was by no means perfect the companies that participated were supportive and understanding of the difficulties involved Nevertheless he continued to explain the sense of exhilaration and reward from the effort of the Chinese companies to expand into world markets as a collective and to let the world become aware of their brand building efforts more than compensated for any gaps in execution Learning from the experience the organizer plans to continue to launch a series of promotional campaigns featuring Chinese brands to remain committed to servicing the international communications needs of the brands and going forward to enhance the understanding that international markets have of Chinese companies The firms that participated in the collective effort daigou

Record breaking students making electric cars cool am BST Students who built an electric car that can accelerate faster than conventional fuel powered cars hope to impress petrol heads Jim Drury met them in Switzerland The makers of AMZ s Fluela want to make electric cars cool It was designed and built by students at ETH Zurich who say its electric motor is superior to those used in professional Formula E racing Each year AMZ enters a new car in Formula Student an engineering design competition for student teams Even though it s up against some fuel powered cars AMZ consistently tops the rankings SOUNDBITE English DANIEL HENTZEN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING STUDENT AT ETH ZURICH AND HEAD OF FLUELA FORMULA STUDENT RACING TEAM SAYING We think it s important to prove that an electric car can compete with combustion cars when it comes to handling and the fun that you get when you drive this car So the acceleration that we have would be unthinkable in a combustion car Last year AMZ broke the world record for acceleration in electric cars SOUNDBITE English DANIEL HENTZEN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING STUDENT AT ETH ZURICH AND HEAD OF FLUELA FORMULA STUDENT RACING TEAM SAYING Last year we set a world record with Grimsel which is the car before Fluela so this car accelerated from zero to kilometres an hour in just seconds in the space of metres Made mainly of carbon fibre Fluela weighs just kilograms And what does its driver think are Fluela s best features SOUNDBITE English FLUELA DRIVER AND ETH ZURICH MECHANICAL ENGINEERING STUDENT JAPHET SCHMID SAYING I guess the four wheel drive with the self developed motors Also the aerodynamic package is quite unique and we have adaptive dampers here at the front and with these we have more mechanical grip than with traditional dampers The team hopes to persuade petrolheads that electric cars are no gimmick They re already planning next year s model confident they re on the fast track to success reut rs MfKDIG
The version of the Dell XPS added an unexpected gem to the company s arsenal back in January Sleek powerful and packing a gorgeous Infinity Display it ramped up the company s reputation in the consumer space and served up a real alternative to inch Apple s MacBook Air The new Dell XPS carries over the XPS s Infinity Display which makes it one of the most compact inch notebooks around Just as the XPS managed to be around the same size as the inch MacBook Air while cramming in a inch display the XPS is only slightly bigger than the inch MacBook Air Lying one on top of the other you can see that the XPS wouldn t give you that much less space than the Air when slung into a backpack At pounds the XPS is noticeably heavier than the Dell XPS but when you consider that it s a inch laptop with dedicated graphics inside you can t really complain There s another advantage to the XPS s inch display in that it has a higher resolution than the XPS The Dell XPS can be configured with up to an UltraSharp K Ultra HD display which offers a pixel resolution of x That means that with even with Windows scaling set to which makes fonts look incredibly crisp you still get the same amount of space on the desktop as a p monitor In comparison the XPS s inch QHD display only gives you the equivalent of a x monitor meaning you get a lot more space on the desktop to snap apps and be productive on the new Dell XPS The XPS s desktop wallpaper and the fonts in Notepad were on another level of clarity to non K displays so much so that it would be difficult going back to anything else In terms of performance the XPS packs muscle underneath the hood It can be configured with up a sixth generation Skylake Intel Core i Quad Core processor backed up by up to GB of fast RAM clocked at MHz The Dell XPS even promises to appeal to gamers though the option to equip it with up to an Nvidia GeForce GTX M graphics with GB of GDDR memory It s equally up to speed on the connectivity front thanks to the inclusion of a Thunderbolt port the newest generation of Type C connectivity that provides up to eight times the transfer speeds of USB up to Gbps in other words You ll be able to use the Dell XPS to power up to two K displays which should provide more pixels than you know what to do with The Dell XPS can be equipped with a Full HD display rather than a K variant which the company claims can go for up to hours on a single battery charge Dell hasn t provided any battery life figures for the K version we tested but you can expect it to achieve at least three or four hours fewer The XPS is once again available with an external battery pack that can be used to juice it up on the move While a subjective point I was never too enamoured with the Dell XPS s keyboard Its chiclet spaced keys were well spaced but felt shallow something that was put down to that machine s thin dimensions It seems that wasn t the case as Dell has ported over the exact same keyboard to the slightly thicker Dell XPS and it feels just as unsatisfying to type on It s bizarre that Dell has chosen to fit its most comfortable keyboard in recent memory on its new Dell XPS hybrid which is a much smaller inch device If Dell had used the same keyboard on the new XPS then it would have ticked every box going Early verdict There are no surprises with the new Dell XPS and that s a good thing If you re seeking a inch laptop and the benefits that come with one without having to lug around a heavy and bulky device the XPS could be the one you ve been waiting for It s solidly built features a gorgeous K display and is just as attractive as Apple and other leading Windows manufacturer s flagship inch systems if not moreso It could even pique the interest of gamers seeking an all round device for productivity work and entertainment thanks to optional Nvidia graphics It s a shame that the XPS s keyboard is once again a shallow affair which may not be a problem if you re not an ardent typist What is a hands on review Hands on reviews are a journalist s first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it It may be just a few moments or a few hours The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it s like to use even if it s only an embryonic view For more information see TechRadar s Reviews Guarantee

be no arguing with the driver on this bus the rides are free and there s no driver anyway Trikala a rural town in northern Greece has been chosen to test a driverless bus in real traffic conditions for the first time part of a European project to revolutionize mass transport and wean its cities off oil dependency over the next years Trials of the French built CityMobil buses started last week and will last through late February Over the past year CityMobil has been tried out near its base in La Rochelle in western France on a campus in Lausanne Switzerland and near Helsinki Finland all in controlled conditions that produced no accidents But in Greece a country of narrow winding hilly streets stray dogs bicycle riders and impatient drivers the buses are up against real traffic The Greek government had to amend its laws to allow the testing and the city had to build a dedicated bus lane that deprived residents of downtown parking spaces The robot buses don t look like science fiction vehicles more like golf cart meets ice cream truck Still heads turn as the skinny battery powered buses hum through the streets They seat only people and are guided by GPS and supplementary sensors including lasers and cameras that send live data to a control center The buses go no faster than kph mph but the trials in Trikala pronounced TREE kah lah potentially represent a major advance for automated transport There were cities bidding for this project all over Europe They offered relatively restricted urban areas But we said we could make it happen in a downtown environment and we won said Odisseas Raptis who heads the city s digital project department e Trikala We have a kilometer mile route the bus route It s mixed with traffic with pedestrians with bicycles with cars That hasn t been done before Vasilis Karavidas chief technician for the project in Greece trained with Robosoft the company that developed the bus in the southwest French town of Bidart Although the driverless buses are fully automated with onboard navigation and obstacle detection systems each vehicle will be monitored by a driver in the control center who can override the system Karavidas said It s as if they are in here and they can stop the bus if they want to if something goes wrong he said The buses are currently running without passengers with full testing to start later this month when a fiber optic network allowing faster data transmission is completed Six battery powered vehicles will eventually be used in this farming town of that has become hooked on high tech Trikala already has already tested EU funded pilot medical programs including schemes to relay heart test data from home to the doctor s office and use tracker devices for Alzheimer patients In the center of the city a digital tree with solar panels allows benches to carry phone charging outlets The nation European Union is targeting gasoline use for city transport as one area where it wants to reduce carbon emissions With oil prices and city populations expected to rise in the coming decades a major shift to battery power and more shared transport could blur the line between private and public vehicles Senior transport analyst Philippe Crist at the International Transport Forum an OECD think tank based in Paris says transport trends are hard to predict as the world moves more toward automation We too often look at technological changes in isolation said Crist There is a good chance that these technologies will create entirely new uses that we can only poorly grasp today The reality is that everything is changing around these technologies and it is plausible that society may lose interest in owning cars or using fixed service public transport especially if these technologies allow better alternatives to emerge Models run by the think tank suggest that city transport could be made massively more efficient Crist said researchers looked at shared and route optimized on call taxi like services replacing all car and bus trips in a mid sized European city We found that these systems could deliver almost the same mobility as today but with percent fewer vehicles Driverless cars and buses offer an easier way to optimize traffic flow while aiming to eliminate human error That has transport developers working at both ends adding automatic features to conventional vehicles while raising the bar for those that will have no driver at all So far the CityMobile has had mixed reviews on the streets of Trikala Not everyone is happy to lose parking spots or replace human jobs with machines Still retiree Michalis Pantelis said he was proud that his city was selected for the testing I think it s wonderful Think how many people will come to Trikala to see this It s new and innovative he said moments after a driverless bus passed by It reminds me of the toy cars my grandchildren play with Online EU Roadmap to Single European Transport Area http goo gl wnSdE Follow

Image Gallery images NASA scientists have used a combination of satellite data and ground based cameras to study pulsating auroras which appear as flickering patches of bright light in the night sky The research gave rise to an unexpected discovery with the data revealing that secondary electrons may play a bigger part in the occurrences than was previously thought There are two kinds of aurora First there are active auroras which appear as elongated arcs of light across the sky and are caused by dense waves of solar material such as solar winds or coronal mass ejections hitting the Earth s magnetic field The collision causes a release of electrons that race towards the poles interacting with particles in the upper atmosphere as they go creating the long patches of glowing sky Pulsating auroras are a little different They re a more internal affair in that they re brought about by complex wave motions in the magnetosphere rather than being stimulated by external events Because of this they can happen at any moment not only at times when solar material hits the magnetic field The magnetic connection between the north and south poles means that pulsating aurora events occur simultaneously at both poles and electrons move constantly back and forth between hemispheres during events shooting along magnetic field lines Those electrons that ping between hemispheres are lower charged secondary electrons kicked up by collisions with more highly charged particles at the poles themselves accelerated by the wave motions in the magnetosphere During the new study the team used data from two satellites one from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency and another from the US Department of Defense s Defense Meteorological Satellite Program examining the volume and energy of electrons during pulsating aurora events The data was compared with footage from all sky cameras at the the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association Radar Facility in Norway and the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska Previous to the study it was thought these secondary electrons which possess far less energy than their primary counterparts played little to no part in pulsating aurorae but the combined observations tell a different story The researchers found that the most significant changes in the shape and structure of the pulsating auroras was observed when there were a low number of secondary electrons moving along magnetic field lines between the hemispheres This strongly suggests that secondary electrons play a big part in pulsating aurora events but further study will be required to clarify the findings We need targeted observations to figure out exactly how to incorporate these low energy secondary electrons into our models says the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center s Marilia Samara But it seems clear that they may very well end up playing a more important role than previously thought 
By ERICA WERNER AP Congressional Correspondent WASHINGTON AP A North Carolina congresswoman thanked fellow Republicans for their support Friday after many received incendiary emails alleging an affair between her and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy according to two Republicans in the closed door meeting The emails arrived at a time of bitter division within the House GOP and the Republican Party nationally with hardline conservatives increasingly at odds with more establishment aligned figures including McCarthy Rep Renee Ellmers stood up to speak in an open microphone portion of the meeting being held the morning after McCarthy shocked the House by taking his name out of contention to become the next speaker She thanked fellow lawmakers for their support and prayers and said she was sorry they had received the emails She described the messages as batshit crazy She said it was daunting to be a woman in Washington but that she was a tough cookie and could handle it McCarthy was not in the room at the time The two Republicans who described Ellmers comments spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the private discussion In a statement later Ellmers said As someone who has been targeted by completely false accusations and innuendo I have been moved by the outpouring of support and prayers from my colleagues constituents and friends Now I will be praying for those who find it acceptable to bear false witness McCarthy denied earlier this week that his decision to withdraw from the speaker s race was related to a letter from one backbench lawmaker demanding that any candidate with embarrassing misdeeds in his past should withdraw In recent days several lawmakers have reported receiving emails about the allegations apparently from a right wing activist known for spamming Republicans McCarthy s spokesman declined comment 
 National Retail Federation WASHINGTON BUSINESS WIRE The National Retail Federation today said it agreed with a warning from the FBI that new chip based credit cards are safer than traditional cards but still vulnerable to fraud and need to be used with a PIN instead of a signature to minimize risk What the FBI is saying is what the rest of the world already sees as common sense NRF Senior Vice President and General Counsel Mallory Duncan said It s the right thing to do and we hope the banks are listening Retailers are determined to protect their customers Duncan said That s why we are pushing the banks to use all of the security the new cards are capable of providing not just half They shouldn t lock the front door but leave the back door wide open In a warning issued on Thursday to consumers merchants and law enforcement the FBI praised Europay MasterCard Visa chip cards as being more secure than traditional magnetic stripe cards but said they are still vulnerable to fraud Despite card industry claims that the chips are difficult to counterfeit the FBI said the cards can be counterfeited using stolen card data obtained from the black market The bureau also said the chip will not likely stop stolen or counterfeit cards from being used online or in telephone purchases When using the EMV card at a point of sale terminal consumers should use the PIN instead of a signature the FBI said This fully utilizes the security features built within the EMV card The FBI encouraged merchants to require that consumers use a PIN rather than signature and said merchants should ask for a government issued photo identification card when customers use a signature Despite the FBI warning virtually all of the chip cards being issued in the United States are chip and signature rather than chip and PIN leaving consumers without the option to use a PIN By contrast EMV cards used in countries around the world for years or more are routinely chip and PIN They re encouraging consumers to use PIN and they re encouraging merchants to request PIN the only thing missing is to encourage the banks to issue PIN cards Duncan said The FBI warning follows last week s deadline for merchants to install chip card readers or face increased fraud liability if a chip card is used in a non chip reader The warning is the second time that the federal government has come down in favor of PIN President Obama last year signed an executive order requiring that credit cards issued to federal government workers have a PIN and that federal facilities that accept credit cards be equipped for PIN NRF has argued for years that the new cards should have both a chip and a secret PIN or personal identification number saying that the combination of both is required to provide sufficient security While chips make the new cards more difficult to counterfeit the chip can be circumvented and the chips do nothing to protect lost and stolen cards from being used A PIN could prevent all of those types of fraud even without the chip NRF has provided a variety of resources explaining the advantages of PIN cards on its data security web page NRF submitted testimony to a congressional committee on Wednesday arguing in favor of PIN over signature NRF is the world s largest retail trade association representing discount and department stores home goods and specialty stores Main Street merchants grocers wholesalers chain restaurants and Internet retailers from the United States and more than countries Retail is the nation s largest private sector employer supporting one in four U S jobs million working Americans Contributing trillion to annual GDP retail is a daily barometer for the nation s economy NRF s This is Retail campaign highlights the industry s opportunities for life long careers how retailers strengthen communities and the critical role that retail plays in driving innovation NRF com View source version on businesswire com http www businesswire com news home en Copyright Business Wire

Carbon Engineering unveils groundbreaking carbon capture project in Squamish B C Project backed by Bill Gates would suck carbon out of the air and turn it into energy By Gemma Karstens Smith The Canadian Press Posted Oct PM PT Last Updated Oct PM PT Senior process engineer Jane Ritchie holds solid calcium carbonate pellets that were formed by precipitating captured carbon dioxide at Calgary based Carbon Engineering s first direct air capture plant in Squamish B C Darryl Dyck Canadian Press Related Stories Greener carbon capture comes closer The mountain air in Squamish B C could soon be even fresher with the launch of a groundbreaking carbon capture operation The pilot project will suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere not from an industrial plant like other such operations with the goal of turning the gas into fuel Built and operated by Calgary based Carbon Engineering the million plant will capture about one tonne of CO per day which is the equivalent of taking about cars off the road annually Founded by Harvard climate scientist David Keith and backed by big name investors including Bill Gates Carbon Engineering has spent several years turning academic research into technology that could be commercialized The company will unveil its pilot plant in Squamish on Friday Potential for larger impact The operation has been capturing CO since May but its primary purpose is to prove that the technology can work on a much larger scale taking in up to one million tonnes per day Calgary based Carbon Engineering s first direct air capture plant in Squamish B C extracts carbon dioxide directly from atmospheric air Darryl Dyck Canadian Press It s still a pilot scale plant explained Adrian Corless Carbon Engineering s CEO But it s very important because it s the first time that anyone s demonstrated a technology that captures CO that has the potential to be scaled up to be large enough to be relevant from an environmental or climate point of view The plant works by moving large volumes of air through a piece of equipment where CO is absorbed by a liquid solution and then transformed into pellets of calcium carbonate The pellets are then heated to or degrees Celsius and break down releasing pure carbon There s no real magic to it Corless said The pieces of equipment already exist today in very large scale And we ve really adapted them from other industries It may not be magic but it is innovative Carbon Engineering is a world leader in direct air carbon capture Corless said Soon the company will take the technology even farther building another system that will turn the captured carbon into useable transportation fuel by adding hydrogen from renewable sources such as solar wind or hydro It s not something that we were the first to think about it Corless said I think we re just the first to be in position with that key piece of technology which is the scalable source of atmospheric CO that allows you to think about making a larger scale fuel synthesis plant Turning CO into fuel Once that plant is running in or it will produce to litres of gasoline or diesel per day and there are already groups interested in buying the product Corless said Senior process engineer Jane Ritchie explains how the pellet reactor system controls work at Calgary based Carbon Engineering s first direct air capture plant in Squamish B C Darryl Dyck Canadian Press Eventually the fuel could be used for ships or planes The nice thing about the technology is that there are no real limitations for it to ultimately in theory displace all of the existing fossil based transportation fuels Corless said Built on the site of a former Nexen chemical facility in Squamish Carbon Engineering s pilot plant is bringing new technology to an area undergoing long term development The pilot plant could be game changing in terms of reducing the global carbon footprint and it could make the mountain town a hub for green technology in the process said Mayor Patricia Heintzman When you start to bring in people who are problem solvers and entrepreneurs who see opportunity when it s there and aren t blind to it that s an exciting place for a community to be You can really grow on that she said I think it s great when smart innovators are coming into a community That s where your future is

LONDON Trade and construction held back Britain s economic growth in the third quarter a fresh batch of official data suggested Friday confirming earlier signs of a slowdown The U K bought abroad billion pounds billion more in goods and services than it sold to the rest of the world the Office for National Statistics said The gulf is GBP billion narrower than July s which was the widest in more than half a year but both months combined already double the deficit registered in the second quarter This means trade would need to be in surplus in September in order to make a positive contribution to economic growth in the third quarter a virtual impossibility because it hasn t happened since Meanwhile weather and summer stoppages drove construction output to fall on the month the largest drop in over two and a half years after dipping in July as well Friday s data add to a hefty amount of indicators showing Britain s economic expansion lost some luster between July and September Many economists believe official data set to be released later this month will reveal the economy grew in the third quarter compared with in the second The Bank of England however remains more optimistic In a set of forecasts released Thursday officials at the central bank said the pace of economic growth was likely to be While government statisticians point out construction figures are unreliable and have lately been prone to upward revisions the U K s weak trade performance has long been a key concern of policymakers and business chambers Exporters have been severely hampered by the strength of the pound business surveys reveal which makes British products more expensive overseas In August sterling hit its highest value in seven and a half years when measured against a basket of other major currencies according to data by the Bank of England Even though the pound has since climbed down easing about in September it remains strong against the euro making it hard for U K firms to tap their number one market for exports According to a key poll of purchasing managers released last week by research firm Markit Economics Ltd output by British manufacturers slipped to a three month low in September This leaves the British economy solely reliant on its powerhouse services sector which has also given signs of slowing in recent months Still in records of their last policy meeting BOE policymakers said recent economic data is consistent with a gentle deceleration a natural consequence of the economy approaching a balance after emerging from the downturn Write to Jon Sindreu at jon sindreu wsj com and Jason Douglas at jason douglas wsj com

The NASA New Horizons probe has beamed back stunning pictures of Pluto which show it has blue skies and ice caps These incredible images prove Pluto has surprisingly Earth like features although scientists have not been able to confirm whether it could hold life Professor Brian Cox recently suggested there could be an ocean beneath Pluto s frozen surface which may be warm enough to hold living organisms Water water everywhere These blue patches show places where water ice has formed NASA scientists were taken aback by the new photographs Who would have expected a blue sky in the Kuiper Belt asked Alan Stern New Horizons principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute It s gorgeous Video loading The colour of the haze reveals important clues about the chemical make up of Pluto s surface as well as its atmosphere That striking blue tint tells us about the size and composition of the haze particles said science team researcher Carly Howett Rex New Horizons snapped this image of Pluto from miles away A blue sky often results from scattering of sunlight by very small particles On Earth those particles are very tiny nitrogen molecules On Pluto they appear to be larger but still relatively small soot like particles we call tholins Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Southwest Research Institute PA Wire Artist s impression of the New Horizons spacecraft These tholins undergo complex chemical reactions high above the surface of Pluto falling back down to the ground where they add to Pluto s red coloring Although the skies are the most beautiful discovery announced today the ice could prove to be more important as it could point to the presence of larger bodies of water NASA JHUAPL SWRI Stunning The Rich Color Variations of Pluto Experts are now examining the pictures in a bid to discover exactly where the water has come from Large expanses of Pluto don t show exposed water ice said science team member Jason Cook This image shows the geology of Pluto and has been dubbed snakeskin by NASA because of the shape of the rocks Understanding why water appears exactly where it does and not in other places is a challenge that we are digging into Stargazers were hoping NASA would announce the presence of alien life today after Alan Stern a planetary scientist for the agency said NASA would reveal an amazing discovery this afternoon Video loading Watch next Watch this video again Watch Next Stern described Pluto as alive and said It has weather it has hazes in the atmosphere and active geology Reuters A near sunset view of the rugged icy mountains and flat ice plains on Pluto However we may not find out whether the planet contains real life for quite some time due to the difficulty of getting to Pluto Professor Brian Cox said last month The New Horizons probe showed you there there may well be a subsurface ocean on Pluto which means if our understanding of life on Earth is even slightly correct that you could have living things there he said We know the surface of Pluto is very young which could indicate high levels of geological activity whilst its also boasts a series of strange nitrogen glaciers NASA has also suggested an underground ocean could be driving all the activity on its surface Video loading Poll loading DailyMirror div
Mars has held a central place in human imagination and culture for millennia Ancients marveled at its red color and the brightness that waxed and waned in cycles over the years Early observations through telescopes led some to speculate that the planet was covered with canals that its inhabitants used for transportation and commerce In The War of the Worlds the writer HG Wells posited a Martian culture that would attempt to conquer Earth In Orson Welles panicked listeners who thought they were listening to a news broadcast rather than his radio adaptation of Wells s novel The real story of humans and Mars is a little more prosaic but no less fascinating Telescopes turned the bright red dot in the sky into a fuzzy mottled disk that gave rise to those daydreams of canals Just years ago the first photograph of Mars from a passing spacecraft appeared to show a hazy atmosphere Now decades of exploration on the planet itself has shown it to be a world that once had open water an essential ingredient for life The fascination hasn t waned even in the Internet Age A former computer programmer named Andy Weir who enjoyed writing for its own sake and posted fiction to his blog started a serial about a NASA astronaut stranded on Mars The popularity ultimately led him to turn it into a successful novel The Martian which has been made into a movie that was released earlier this month The Martian merges the fictional and factual narratives about Mars building upon the work NASA and others have done exploring Mars and moving it forward into the s when NASA astronauts are regularly traveling to Mars and living on the surface to explore Although the action takes place years in the future NASA is already developing many of the technologies that appear in the film some of which are highlighted here HABITAT On the surface of Mars in The Martian Watney spends a significant amount of time in the habitation module the Hab his home away from home Future astronauts who land on Mars will need such a home to avoid spending their Martian sols lying on the dust in a spacesuit At NASA Johnson Space Center crews train for long duration deep space missions in the Human Exploration Research Analog HERA HERA is a self contained environment that simulates a deep space habitat The two storeyed habitat is complete with living quarters workspaces a hygiene module and a simulated airlock Within the module test subjects conduct operational tasks complete payload objectives and live together for days soon planned to increase to up to days simulating future missions in the isolated environment Astronauts have recently used the facility to simulate ISS missions These research analogs provide valuable data in human factors behavioral health and countermeasures to help further NASA s understanding on how to conduct deep space operations PLANT FARM Today astronauts on the International Space Station ISS have an abundance of food delivered to them by cargo resupply vehicles including some from commercial industries On Mars humans would not be able to rely on resupply missions from Earth even with express delivery they would take at least nine months For humans to survive on Mars they will need a continuous source of food They will need to grow crops Watney turns the Hab into a self sustaining farm in The Martian making potatoes the first Martian staple Today in low Earth orbit lettuce is the most abundant crop in space Aboard the International Space Station Veggie is a deployable fresh food production system Using red blue and green lights Veggie helps plants grow in pillows small bags with a wicking surface containing media and fertiliser to be harvested by astronauts In astronauts used the system to grow Outredgeous red romaine lettuce and just recently sampled this space grown crop for the first time This is a huge step in space farming and NASA is looking to expand the amount and type of crops to help meet the nutritional needs of future astronauts on Mars WATER RECOVERY There are no lakes river or oceans on the surface of Mars and sending water from Earth would take more than nine months Astronauts on Mars must be able to create their own water supply The Ares crew does not waste a drop on Mars with their water reclaimer and Watney needs to use his ingenuity to come up with some peculiar ways to stay hydrated and ensure his survival on the Red Planet On the International Space Station no drop of sweat tears or even urine goes to waste The Environmental Control and Life Support System recovers and recycles water from everywhere urine hand washing oral hygiene and other sources Through the Water Recovery System WRS water is reclaimed and filtered ready for consumption One astronaut simply put it Yesterday s coffee turns into tomorrow s coffee Liquid presents some tricky problems in space The WRS and related systems have to account for the fact that liquids behave very differently in a microgravity environment The part of the WRS that processes urine must use a centrifuge for distillation since gases and liquids do not separate like they do on Earth NASA is continuing to develop new technologies for water recovery Research is being conducted to advance the disposable multifiltration beds the filters that remove inorganic and non volatile organic contaminants to be a more permanent component to the system Brine water recovery would reclaim every drop of the water from the bottoms product leftover from urine distillation For future human exploration missions crews would be less dependent on any resupply of spare parts or extra water from Earth The technology behind this system has been brought down to Earth to provide clean drinking water to remote locations and places devastated with natural disasters MARS SPACESUIT The Martian surface is not very welcoming for humans The atmosphere is cold and there is barely any breathable air An astronaut exploring the surface must wear a spacesuit to survive outside of a habitat while collecting samples and maintaining systems Mark Watney spends large portions of his Martian sols a sol is a Martian day working in a spacesuit He ends up having to perform some long treks on the surface so his suit has to be flexible comfortable and reliable NASA is currently developing the technologies to build a spacesuit that would be used on Mars Engineers consider everything from traversing the Martian landscape to picking up rock samples The Z and Prototype eXploration Suit NASA s new prototype spacesuits help solve unique problems to advance new technologies that will one day be used in a suit worn by the first humans to set foot on Mars Each suit is meant to identify different technology gaps features a spacesuit may be missing to complete a mission Spacesuit engineers explore the tradeoff between hard composite materials and fabrics to find a nice balance between durability and flexibility One of the challenges of walking on Mars will be dealing with dust The red soil on Mars could affect the astronauts and systems inside a spacecraft if tracked in after a spacewalk To counter this new spacesuit designs feature a suitport on the back so astronauts can quickly hop in from inside a spacecraft while the suit stays outside keeping it clean indoors ROVER Once humans land on the surface of Mars they must stay there for more than a year while the planets move into a position that will minimize the length of their trip home This allows the astronauts plenty of time to conduct experiments and explore the surrounding area but they won t want to be limited to how far they can go on foot Astronauts will have to use robust reliable and versatile rovers to travel farther In The Martian Watney takes his rover for quite a few spins and he even has to outfit the vehicle with some unorthodox modifications to help him survive On Earth today NASA is working to prepare for every encounter with the Multi Mission Space Exploration Vehicle MMSEV The MMSEV has been used in NASA s analog mission projects to help solve problems that the agency is aware of and to reveal some that may be hidden The technologies are developed to be versatile enough to support missions to an asteroid Mars its moons and other missions in the future NASA s MMSEV has helped address issues like range rapid entry exit and radiation protection Some versions of the vehicle have six pivoting wheels for maneuverability In the instance of a flat tire the vehicle simply lifts up the bad wheel and keeps on rolling ION PROPULSION Slow and steady wins the race and ion propulsion proves it In The Martian the Ares crew lives aboard the Hermes spacecraft for months as they travel to and from Mars using ion propulsion to traverse million miles inspace Ion propulsion allows the spacecraft to change its orbit multiple times then break away and head for another distant world This allows modern day spacecraft like NASA s Dawn Spacecraft to minimize fuel consumption and perform some crazy maneuvers Dawn has completed more than five years of continuous acceleration for a total velocity change around mph more than any spacecraft has accomplished on its own OXYGEN GENERATION Food water shelter three essentials for survival on Earth But there s a fourth we don t think about much because it s freely available oxygen On Mars to survive Watney has to carry his own supply of oxygen everywhere he goes But first he has to make it In his Hab he uses the oxygenator a system that generates oxygen using the carbon dioxide from the MAV Mars Ascent Vehicle fuel generator On the ISS the astronauts and cosmonauts have the Oxygen Generation System which reprocesses the atmosphere of the spacecraft to continuously provide breathable air efficiently and sustainably The system produces oxygen through a process called electrolysis which splits water molecules into their component oxygen and hydrogen atoms The oxygen is released into the atmosphere while the hydrogen is either discarded into space or fed into the Sabatier System which creates water from the remaining byproducts in the station s atmosphere Oxygen is produced at more substantial rate through a partially closed loop system that improves the efficiency of how the water and oxygen are used NASA is working to recover even more oxygen from byproducts in the atmosphere to prepare for the journey to Mars solar panels The Hermes spacecraft in The Martian uses solar arrays for power and Mark Watney has to use solar panels in some unconventional ways to survive on Mars On the ISS four sets of solar arrays generate to kilowatts of electricity enough to power more than homes Orion NASA s spacecraft that will take humans farther than they ve ever gone before will use solar arrays for power in future missions The arrays can gather power while in sunlight to charge onboard lithium ion batteries In case no sunlight is available for instance if Orion were to go behind the Moon there would still be plenty of power to allow it to operate RADIOISOTOPE THERMOELECTRIC GENERATORS RTG For more than four decades NASA has safely used Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators RTGs to provide electrical power for two dozen space missions including Apollo missions to the Moon Spacecraft such as the Mars rover Curiosity and the upcoming Mars rover use an updated next generation model for electrical power RTGs are space batteries that convert heat from the natural radioactive decay of plutonium into reliable electrical power The RTG on Curiosity generates about Watts of power or less slightly more than an average light bulb uses In The Martian the crew buries the plutonium based RTG power source for the Mars Ascent Vehicle far away from the Hab in case of radioactive leakage In reality the natural radiation environment on Mars is more extreme than the radiation produced from an RTG Ionizing radiation raining down on Mars from space is far more hazardous to human health Current Mars missions are analysing the Martian radiation environment so that mission planners can design protection systems for future astronauts Future explorers will need assured reliable and durable power sources for survival in place before they arrive Power system options might include a mix of more efficient radioisotope power systems solar power fuel cells and nuclear fission 
New Cloud Entrant in Student Admissions Ties to Financial and HR By Dian Schaffhauser Workday a company better known for its cloud based HR and financial systems software is releasing Student Admissions an application to help institutions with enrollment This comes just about a year after the company kicked off its first mobile first application for higher ed Student Recruiting Both programs integrate with Workday s Human Capital Management HCM and Financial Management software The announcement came during the company s user conference which took place last week During the same event Workday also unveiled a learning application for managing career development Workday Student Admissions as it s being called is the second application available in the Student suite Functionality includes an eligibility framework that lets schools define a set of application requirements that can be further configured for specific academic divisions departments and programs of study Institutions will be able to create applicant pools based on categories such as program region and standardized test scores to allow admissions advisors to analyze data and identify trends Workday Student Admissions With a tie in to Workday HCM applicant pools may also be assigned to specific counselors and their workloads managed For example those applicants for a particular program could be pooled and assigned to a set of advisors who could coordinate response and track students as a group That same integration would allow administrators to track admission staff performance against admission goals The program will enable automatic assignment of application rating values based on criteria such as readiness demonstrated interest and the outcome of applicant interviews including prerequisite coursework and standardized test scores derived through data from the Student Recruiting module Applicants will be able to view the status of outstanding items tied to their application And the program includes features to help schools communicate with individuals or groups of applicants electronically and by mail The director dashboard within Workday Student Admissions The student admissions program is available as part of the company s latest release Workday which also has enhancements to its financial HCM and recruiting modules The company said future components of the Student suite would address management of curriculum student records academic advising financial aid and student financials The portfolio in its entirety is expected to be completed by the end of next year According to the company colleges and universities have provided feedback for the design of the program which is also mobile enabled Florida s Tallahassee Community College which was part of that feedback process noted that participation was invaluable Student success is at the core of what we do We take that responsibility seriously with more than students selecting our college each year with the goal of transferring to a university or moving directly towards a career said Shanna Autry director of student success and retention in a press release It s invaluable to be part of the design process for Workday Student because it helps us ensure that we have a system that supports future efforts and enables our faculty and staff to efficiently and effectively recruit and admit the best students for our program Workday s new Learning program will use data taken from Workday HCM to understand where a person resides in the employee lifecycle new to the organization recently promoted or lacking specific skills for a current position and make recommendations for training The program was expected to be available in the second half of California College of the Arts an institution that has evaluated the company s plans for Learning said it appeared to have the potential to meet the training needs of its staff and faculty Learning built into Workday HCM will serve as a community wide tool that can help overcome many of the boundary limitations found in a traditional LMS where the line between community members are hardened and social and collaboration components are bolted on rather than unified in one system said CIO Mara Hancock in a prepared statement Other higher education customers of Workday include New York s Cornell University California s Grossmont Cuyamaca Community College District and Vermont s Champlain College About the Author Dian Schaffhauser is a writer who covers technology and business for a number of publications Contact her at dian dischaffhauser com

Cape Town Ten cents a day That was what KwaZulu Natal High Court judge Mjabuliseni Madondo once earned as a farm labourer before he went on to study law and worked his way up to the bench It was for this reason that Madondo who is applying for the post of deputy judge president in KwaZulu Natal felt passionately about the plight of farm workers and the poor who are often unable to take their disputes to court In many cases these litigants would lose because they were not properly represented or could not understand the language spoken in court Living an isolated life with other farm workers and tenants at the farm in Msinga near Greytown where he was raised Madondo told the Judicial Service Commission JSC that while there he only knew about customary and traditional laws

Is your digital information more at risk today than years ago October by Karen Wentworth It s easy to form the mental image of a hacker hunched over a computer probing a way to get your personal information whether to sell it acquire credit cards in your name or use your health insurance It does happen but University of New Mexico Department of Computer Science Professor Stephanie Forrest and Ph D student Benjamin Edwards working with Steven Hofmeyr from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Berkeley Lab say it is not happening more frequently than it did a decade ago Data breaches in general are not growing in size Cybersecurity has become a global problem and to tackle it effectively will require careful analysis of complex datasets from diverse sources said Forrest This study illustrates how modern data science can shed light on one of today s most challenging problems In a new paper titled Hype and Heavy Tails A Closer Look at Data Breaches which won the Best Paper Award at the Workshop on the Economics of Information Security in June the researchers looked at both malicious and negligent breaches Malicious breaches occur when attackers specifically target someone s personal information Negligent breaches occur when someone s private information is accidentally exposed for example if a database of personnel records is stored on a laptop that is lost or stolen They used information published by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse a private non profit that tracks public reports of data breaches and they note that their results are drawn from publicly acknowledged data breaches The researchers constructed a statistical model based on public data about breaches collected over the last decade and used the model to analyze trends and make predictions about future breaches The data clearly showed that information is exposed twice as often through negligence as it is from malicious attacks Using expanded data that includes high profile data breaches form this summer the model also predicts that there is a percent chance of a breach that exposes more than million records during the next three years What is the bottom line that is what is the real cost in dollars of these data breaches Estimating financial costs of breaches accurately also requires analyzing their cost The research team applied some existing cost models to project that over the next three years data breaches could cost individuals companies and public entities up to billion With this work our goal was to answer the questions Are security breaches getting bigger Are they happening more frequently And when they do happen are the impacts more catastrophic When we fit the cyber security data to the statistical model we found a long tail distribution which is liable to distort public perception says Hofmeyr It s kind of like if you ve just experienced a big earthquake you may suddenly be scared of big earthquakes even though the probability for big earthquakes hasn t changed It s the same for security And the reason that we can say that is because we have this principled statistical model which gives us a more comprehensive and contextual view than simply looking at averages There s a take away message for public policy experts in this Industry reports which are widely circulated and difficult to confirm often use inappropriate statistical techniques and should be taken with a large grain of salt Policies that encourage uniform reporting of security problems would provide clarity in this very murky area Edwards summed it up So much of our current understanding about security problems relies on private data and opaque analysis methods Studies like ours provide a rational counterpoint for policy makers and they show the benefit of putting data about security problems into the public domain 
Politics and anti Supra Mahumapelo statements dominated speeches at the memorial service of the slain property and construction mogul Wandile Bozwana in North West today One ANC member who identified himself as Mothusi Montwedi from Taung commented on his own party saying it was not a caring organisation He added that there was nothing wrong with the party but the problem was that the ANC is infiltrated by the Premier League who uses money and power to influence decisions We re not afraid of Supra as chairperson of the ANC in the province There s an evolution of leadership in the ANC and his time will come to an end Montwedi said to loud cheers Mahumapelo Free State Premier Ace Magashule and Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza have been accused of being part of an informal group of lobbyists in the ANC known as the Premier League 
Atlatls and arrowheads Primitive technology expert pens second book on prehistoric tools and use Scott Jones is one of the nation s top experts on primitive technology the tools used by humans and human ancestors tens of thousands even millions of years ago He s intensely interested in things like arrowheads stone axes and atlatls which are ancient devices used for launching spears with amazing speed and force He s like a lot of archaeologists in his fascination with prehistoric implements but with one big difference from most Jones doesn t just study tools made of antler and bone rawhide and stone he makes them He s also an expert in things like making fire with friction and even considerably more modern pioneer skills such as hewing logs for use in making cabins My hands on approach gives me a different perspective on archaeology he said The envy of any survivalist and there s even a wilderness survival guide on his website www mediaprehistoria com Jones has made hundreds upon hundreds of tools that humans and human ancestors made and used over the past three decades as one of the country s few full time primitive technology specialists Sometimes the tools are for study or to teach himself things sometimes for museum replicas often he makes them in demonstrations for school groups or classes like the University of Georgia anthropology class that watched him zip through two and half million years of human progress in minutes Thursday He also writes about making these tools how they were used and so on and seven years ago collected a lot of those writings into a book A view to the Past Experience and Experiment in Primitive Technology was in large part a how to book for anyone who might want to try things like using pitch for glue pressure flaking a sharp projective point arrowhead to most of us or making a simple lodge such as the Yuchi Indians might have constructed long ago Jones thought he d said all he wanted to about tool making and use in that first book but he was wrong now he s come out with another one he calls Postcards to the Past Context and Continuity in Primitive Technology The new book is also part how to it s got chapters on how to make arrow points from sharp gar fish scales using a glue derived from the long fish s skin for example But it s also full of ideas Jones has been thinking about during nearly three decades of making these tools Even though it s still a lot hands on it s a little more philosophical and archaeological In nearly years of doing this stuff you develop some opinions on things said Jones a University of Georgia graduate who lives in Oglethorpe County s Vesta community The new book is also somewhat more focused on the prehistoric cultures and technology of this part of the world the Southeast and the Piedmont region that includes the Athens area He also muses in some unexpected directions such as fire cracked rock and what archaeologists ought to think about when they study such rocks and other things they find that bear evidence of being through fire They are often cracked simply because the rocks cracked while they were being used in cooking but things are not always as they seem according to Jones As a research method he s taken to burning all sorts of things that might be found by archaeologists exploring something like the centuries old buried remains of a Native American habitation Burn some of everything Jones advises When you burn it you learn a lot about what it looks like Follow education reporter Lee Shearer at www facebook com LeeShearerABH or https twitter com LeeShearer OnlineAthens com aims to foster constructive respectful civic conversation With your help we will provide a friendly safe easy to use place on the Web for everyone in the area to share not only opinions but also information of community interest Racist harassing abusive and libelous comments will not be tolerated By logging in or creating a new account you agree to our Terms of Service If you are logging in for the first time after June you will need to create a new account Go to the previous story

On Friday the House of Representatives will vote on Big Oil s pet cause Letting oil companies export crude that began to spew from fracked wells around It s not a bad idea just a bit oversold But the crucial thing is to tie exports to a sustained push for renewable energy including subsidies needed for now to keep America on the clean energy path serious people know is necessary Industry friendly analysts largely agree the direct effects of lifting the ban would be minor It would lift the price for American crude a few dollars Oslo based Rystad Energy analyst Per Magnus Nysveen said Pump prices would not necessarily be affected as refined products are already exported and thus are connected to international crude markets Realistically if the ban goes the price of West Texas Intermediate crude CLX which reflects U S oil sloshing around a confined market will converge with the Brent crude price LCOX that the rest of the world follows That s about more per domestic barrel if WTI goes all the way to Brent s price The rule of thumb from consulting firm IHS CERA has been that a jump in crude translates to about a quarter per gallon price hike at gasoline stations So the ban would cost you maybe cents a gallon it s as if the average American gave back the one week price drop this Labor Day Drivers ignore such micro fluctuations all the time In exchange the industry would add barrels a day of production on a base of million and maybe billion in added investment in exploration Nysveen says That wouldn t be likely to put much of a dent in the jobs the industry has shed this year Bottom line for all the noise the bill is attracting in Washington it s not that important Except for one thing And that one thing is the ability of this much coveted piece of legislation to leverage a broader energy deal of the kind I proposed in this space last November An op ed by Gregg Easterbrook in The New York Times made almost the same case this week Certainly business lobbies are dying to get the export ban lifted The U S Chamber of Commerce is touting the bill as key to everything from gas prices to geopolitics citing an IHS CERA claim that a free market in oil would add million jobs far more than Rystad s analysis If so liberals should ask what are we bid And the ask should be extended support for renewable energy as an unusually comprehensive new report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance demonstrates at once how much that support is needed and how rapidly it is beginning to pay off New Energy Finance finds that solar and especially wind are already cost competitive with fossil fuel based electricity in parts of Europe In the U S we re not there yet Globally the average cost of onshore wind power fell to per megawatt hour compared with for coal fired juice in the Americas and for gas plants Solar is more expensive globally but is cheaper than coal and gas in some U S states at least some of the time One way that s been done is with the help of tax credits that were allowed to expire last year which reduce the risk of new wind and solar projects No less a Republican economic sage than presidential nominee Jeb Bush whoops has called for letting these credits expire in a few years claiming they re unnecessary a bit of intellectual legerdemain Donald Trump might call low energy But they re not No less a Democratic leaning economic sage than Warren Buffett who has invested billions in wind energy in Iowa caucuses anyone has said subsidies are still crucial to the economics of renewables Bush is degrees wrong The inflection point renewables are at calls for stepping on the gas not slamming the brakes The tax subsidies cost only about billion a year and have tripled wind and solar electricity generation since Renewables lobbyists want them extended for two years in the year end bills to keep the government from shutting down again Five years would be smarter President Obama wants to make them permanent as lifting the export ban would be The deal is simple One of yours for one of ours Oil gets its worldwide market which eliminates an artificial constraint on U S prices The future gets low carbon power whose cost advantages will grow over time In a Washington that functions this is an easy deal to make But is that the Washington we ve got 
New study shows that varying walking pace burns more calories Ohio State University IMAGE By conducting walking experiments in Ohio State s Movement Lab pictured researchers Manoj Srinivasan left and Nidhi Seethapathi found that walking at varying speeds can burn up to percent more view more Credit Photo by Matt Schutte courtesy of The Ohio State University COLUMBUS Ohio Looking for a simple way to burn more calories while walking Change up your pace In a study published in the September issue of the journal Biology Letters engineering researchers at The Ohio State University found that walking at varying speeds can burn up to percent more calories compared to maintaining a steady pace The study is one of the first to measure the metabolic cost or calories burned of changing walking speeds Most of the existing literature has been on constant speed walking This study is a big missing piece said Manoj Srinivasan co author of the study and professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering Measuring the metabolic cost of changing speeds is very important because people don t live their lives on treadmills and do not walk at constant speeds We found that changing speeds can increase the cost of walking substantially Their results show that by using traditional methods people may be underestimating the number of calories burned while walking in daily life or playing sports The very act of changing speeds burns energy Srinivasan explained but that cost is not generally accounted for in calorie burning estimations The researchers found that up to eight percent of the energy we use during normal daily walking could be due to the energy needed to start and stop walking Walking at any speed costs some energy but when you re changing the speed you re pressing the gas pedal so to speak Changing the kinetic energy of the person requires more work from the legs and that process certainly burns more energy explained Nidhi Seethapathi first author of the study and doctoral fellow in mechanical engineering The researchers measured the cost of changing walking speeds by having people change their walking pace on a treadmill while its speed remained steady Participants alternated between walking quickly to move to the front of the treadmill belt or slowly to move to the back of the treadmill watch a video demonstration Prior experiments by other researchers changed the treadmill speed directly which it turns out makes such experiments not applicable to real world walking Srinivasan explained When the treadmill speed is changing the treadmill itself is doing some of the work instead of the person walking The study also confirmed the researchers prediction that people walk slower when covering shorter distances and increase their pace as distance increases This finding could have implications for the field of physical therapy and rehabilitation where measuring the speed it takes to cover a certain distance is used as an indicator of a patient s progress What we ve shown is the distance over which you make them walk matters said Seethapathi You ll get different walking speeds for different distances Some people have been measuring these speeds with relatively short distances which our results suggest might be systematically underestimating progress For more tips on how to burn more calories when walking Srinivasan who leads the Movement Lab at Ohio State offers some simple advice walk in a way that feels unnatural How do you walk in a manner that burns more energy Just do weird things Walk with a backpack walk with weights on your legs Walk for a while then stop and repeat that Walk in a curve as opposed to a straight line he said This work was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation Award Disclaimer AAAS and EurekAlert are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system

Gallery CHICAGO AP Cancer is much less common in elephants than in humans even though the big beasts bodies have many more cells That s a paradox known among scientists and now researchers think they may have an explanation one they say might someday lead to new ways to protect people from cancer Compared with just one copy in humans elephants cells contain copies of a major cancer suppressing gene two teams of scientists report The gene helps damaged cells repair themselves or self destruct when exposed to cancer causing substances The findings aren t proof that those extra p genes make elephants cancer resistant but if future research confirms it scientists could try to develop drugs for humans that would mimic the effect Dr Joshua Schiffman a pediatric cancer specialist at the University of Utah who led one of the teams began his research after hearing a lecture a few years ago about Peto s paradox That refers to the fact that large animals including elephants and whales have comparatively low cancer rates even though they have many more cells than smaller species Cancer involves uncontrolled cell growth The lecture speaker mentioned that elephants seemed to have extra copies of the p gene Schiffman s patients include children with incomplete p genes because of a condition called Li Fraumeni syndrome which greatly increases their chances of developing cancer So Schiffman sought to find clues from the blood of eight elephants Ringling Bros circus animals and local zoo animals His team as well as a second group of scientists pinned down the size of the elephants surplus copies The second team found many other species have only one copy just like humans Schiffman and his colleagues compared how elephant cells reacted to radiation compared with cells from healthy humans and patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome The elephant cells self destructed at twice the rate of healthy human cells and more than five times the rate of cells from patients with the syndrome Cells that don t self repair or self destruct when exposed to carcinogens become prone to developing cancer The work was published Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association Dr Judy Garber director of cancer genetics and prevention at Dana Farmer Cancer Institute in Boston said the research is intriguing but preliminary While the research won t lead to any immediate treatment for humans progress against cancer can come from unexpected directions said Dr Ted Gansler of the American Cancer Society He noted that studies of eyelid and tooth development in mice led to drugs used for colon cancer throat cancer and several other cancers Schiffman s team also analyzed necropsy data and found that elephants sometimes live as long as humans yet only about in die of cancer versus about in humans The second group of researchers working with frozen zoo specimens looked at more than other species and found only elephants and wooly mammoths their extinct relatives had extra copies of the cancer suppressing gene This team inserted elephants p genes into mouse cells and found that those cells behaved just like elephants and self destructed when exposed to DNA damaging drugs said co author Vincent Lynch an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago His study is under review for publication and was released online this week Schiffman s team is seeking funding for research into possible treatments based on the elephant research While studies in humans are at least several years away we certainly think we ve found something very intriguing

The latest news about biotechnologies biomechanics synthetic biology genomics biomediacl engineering Posted Oct Analyzing protein structures in their native environment Nanowerk News Proteins can fold in different ways depending on their environment These different configurations change the function of the protein misfolding is frequently associated with diseases such as Alzheimer s and Parkinson s Until now it has been difficult to fully characterize the different structures that proteins can take on in their natural environments However using a new technique known as sensitivity enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance NMR MIT researchers have shown that they can analyze the structure that a yeast protein forms as it interacts with other proteins in a cell Using this type of NMR which is based on a technique known as dynamic nuclear polarization DNP scientists can gain much more insight into protein structure and function than is possible with current NMR technology which requires large quantities of purified proteins isolated from their usual environment Dynamic nuclear polarization has a capacity to transform our understanding of biological structures in their native contexts says Susan Lindquist a professor of biology at MIT member of the Whitehead Institute and one of the senior authors of the paper which appears in the Oct issue of Cell Sensitivity Enhanced NMR Reveals Alterations in Protein Structure by Cellular Milieus Antiparallel beta sheet structure of the enzyme catalase The antiparallel hydrogen bonds dotted are between peptide NH and CO groups on adjacent strands Arrows indicate the chain direction and electron density contours outline the non H atoms Image Wikimedia Commons edited by MIT News Robert Griffin an MIT professor of chemistry and director of the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory is also a senior author of the paper Kendra Frederick a former Whitehead postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Texas Southwestern is the paper s lead author DNP enhanced sensitivity Traditional NMR uses the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei to reveal the structures of the molecules containing those nuclei By using a strong magnetic field that interacts with the nuclear spins of carbon atoms in the proteins NMR measures a trait known as chemical shift for some of the individual atoms in the sample which can reveal how those atoms are connected You look at changes in chemical shift and that tells you for example if there is an alpha helix or a beta sheet which are two different conformations that a protein backbone often takes Frederick says However traditional NMR is not very sensitive because it only allows you to obtain information from the carbon nuclei in a sample which occur at percent natural abundance For the past years Griffin s lab has been developing dynamic nuclear polarization which requires transferring polarization from unpaired electrons to protons and then carbon nuclei using microwaves generated by a gyrotron a high frequency microwave oscillator developed in collaboration with Richard Temkin of MIT s Department of Physics and Plasma Science and Fusion Center In addition Tim Swager and his group in the MIT Department of Chemistry have developed paramagnetic polarizing agents for the experiments This allows researchers to boost signal intensities in carbon NMR spectra by factors of to a very significant increase in sensitivity With traditional solid state NMR about milligrams of purified protein are needed to get information within a reasonable amount of time But with the boost in sensitivity from DNP the protein no longer needs to be purified and it can be analyzed in quantities that would normally be found inside a cell It s opening up a completely new set of problems that we can access Frederick says Using the sensitivity enhancement technique allows you to look at the protein at the correct levels which is really important when you re thinking about its biology To make sure they are getting data only on the protein of interest the researchers label their target protein with carbon a stable isotope of carbon while the rest of the proteins are unlabeled This technique has the potential to really open up a wide range of studies under physiological conditions that no one has been able to do before says Tim Cross director of the NMR program at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and a professor at Florida State University You don t have to crystallize the proteins you don t have to put them into a uniform solution You can study them in their natural environment and that s tremendously exciting says Cross who was not part of the research team Protein folding In the Cell paper the researchers analyzed a yeast protein called Sup which Lindquist s lab has been studying for many years Sup is a prion a type of protein that can form tangled clumps known as amyloids Its usual function is to help cells terminate protein translation but when it takes on an amyloid structure it stops performing that function These are both normal states for the yeast protein but when human proteins form amyloids they are usually associated with diseases especially neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s Parkinson s and Huntington s as well as rheumatoid arthritis In previous studies using traditional NMR with purified Sup protein scientists have found that a large section of the protein which forms the amyloid has a beta sheet structure which resembles the folds of an accordion Another large section is intrinsically disordered and tends to flop around instead of forming a consistent structure However in the new study when the researchers looked at Sup surrounded by other cellular proteins they found that the intrinsically disordered region actually does take on a regular structure which they believe to be beta sheets However more powerful resolution is needed to tell for sure Frederick says Frederick plans to continue using this NMR technique to study other yeast proteins as well as human amyloid proteins In particular she wants to study why proteins can take on different conformations in different types of cells

The property developer who accuses Mark Zuckerberg of breaking a promise to introduce him to Silicon Valley s elite lost the lawyer who got him to the brink of trial and told a judge he needs time to find a new one Attorney David Draper who shepherded developer Mircea Voskerician s claims in a case challenging the Facebook Inc founder s integrity won a judge s permission Thursday to bow out of the lawsuit after citing rules of professional conduct Whoever takes his place will face an escalating effort by Zuckerberg to undermine Voskerician s credibility Zuckerberg s attorneys have alleged the developer s proposal to build a square foot house with a view into his bedroom was just a bluff to get a payoff from the year old billionaire In his latest offensive Zuckerberg is contesting the authenticity of a bank statement showing Voskerician had million to support his cash offer for the property Patrick Gunn a lawyer for Zuckerberg told the judge Thursday he thinks claims about the fraudulent bank statement that he raised in a Sept filing precipitated Draper s request two weeks later to leave the case Draper has declined to comment on the allegations about the bank statement or why he wanted off the case Professional Conduct In his written request to withdraw from the case Draper referred to an unspecified conflict with his client One of California s rules of professional conduct that he cited forbids an attorney to litigate a matter that is not warranted under existing law or is for the purpose of harassing or maliciously injuring any person A lawyer representing his firm at Thursday s hearing Martin Dioli said during a break in the hearing the judge made the right decision to let Draper withdraw while declining to comment on Gunn s speculation that it was related to the bank statement Voskerician told Superior Court Judge Patricia Lucas that while he s been shopping for a lawyer to replace Draper he hasn t found anyone willing to sign on with a trial scheduled just weeks away The judge directed Voskerician to huddle with Zuckerberg s lawyers to discuss putting the case on hold Gunn said in an interview afterward that he told Voskerician that he wasn t willing to postpone the Nov trial Voskerician declined to comment outside the hearing Court Battle The court battle grew out of Zuckerberg s agreement in to pay Voskerician million for rights to buy the house behind the CEO s home in Palo Alto California The developer claims he gave Zuckerberg a percent discount based on promised introductions and referrals in Silicon Valley that never materialized Zuckerberg s lawyers have failed to stop the case from advancing toward trial even as they have challenged almost every aspect of Voskerician s role in the deal The lawyers allege Voskerician lied about competing offers for the property including one on behalf of an unidentified African prince He grossly misrepresented his homebuilding experience and lacked financing to buy the property in question let alone take on a multimillion dollar construction project they said in court filings They questioned the legitimacy of Voskerician s funding after he said in a deposition that he made hundreds of thousands of dollars selling medical equipment from his previous employer on eBay under a different name In court filings Draper argued his client s alleged misrepresentations were irrelevant because Zuckerberg didn t rely on them in his decision to buy the property rights Troubling Questions Zuckerberg s lawyers contend the Wells Fargo bank statement raises particularly troubling questions because one copy of it turned over by Voskerician in January to prove his financing was solid shows that as of Sept the developer had in his account Another version disclosed last month by a lender who worked with Voskerician shows a balance of on the same date Whether plaintiff has the financial means to actually fund such a project is thus an issue at the heart of this case Zuckerberg s lawyers wrote If proven to be fabricated the bank statement may have driven Draper from the case said David Min a law professor at the University of California at Irvine who s been following the lawsuit Zuckerberg was throwing a bunch of arguments at the wall to see what would work Min said While hints of specious funding from the African prince and sales of used medical equipment were colorful you can make a much stronger case with the bank account he said Ambulance Chaser If the bank statement is found to be falsified even your classic ambulance chaser would hesitate to take it on and at the very least would want to know what s going on the law professor said The judge has rejected most of Zuckerberg s requests to have individual claims decided in his favor without need of a trial Min said Voskerician was in great shape after the judge last week cleared the final hurdles to presenting his case to a jury The developer claims Zuckerberg used him to get the neighboring property as cheaply as he could and then walked away from his obligation Among the evidence cited by the judge in her decision to let a jury decide fraud claims against Zuckerberg was a November e mail to his financial adviser Divesh Makan leading to a meeting the next month in which the CEO and Voskerician closed the deal Feel free to use meeting me as a negotiating carrot with them Zuckerberg wrote to Makan according to the ruling That likely has real soft value to them and may make them more likely to want to give us a good deal Lucas also referenced an e mail from Makan who the judge ruled must face conspiracy claims in Voskerician s lawsuit Sara Petersen Graves a lawyer for Makan declined to comment Thursday We are trying to wow these schmucks so they will accept an offer for the home that is reasonable Makan wrote The plan is to have Zuckerberg spend min with them make them feel special etc Perhaps you can prepare goodie bags as well The case is

Transit of St Louis MTL By using HDP LHPT helps keep MTL buses operating safely and reliably serving the greater St Louis region all year round Initiating a proactive bus maintenance program MTL developed the K Plan to combine historical data on bus component failures comply with changing emission standards and adjust to a smaller work force To deliver on the K Plan the LHPT data science team ran algorithms on HDP for pattern recognition to correlate events to component failures and weed out maintenance inefficiencies As a result MTL can predict when a component on a particular bus will fail raising the average time between bus failures by a factor of five We did not expect to get as much information as we did with access to data from HDP said Darren Curry chief mechanical officer for MTL I still believe that we will be able to increase our performance with LHPT and Hortonworks another two to three times on top of what we have achieved MTL estimates that since initiating the K Plan solution on its buses the mean time between failures has further extended by to miles With the launch of the K Plan MTL also experienced improvement on operating mileage and a percent increase in

creating a skyrmion in the film purple arrows The skyrmion which is stable at room temperature might be usable in computer memory systems Credit Dustin Gilbert NIST Close What can skyrmions do for you These ghostly quantum rings heretofore glimpsed only under extreme laboratory conditions just might be the basis for a new type of computer memory that never loses its grip on the data it stores Now thanks to a research team including scientists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST the exotic ring shaped magnetic effects have been coaxed out of the physicist s deepfreeze with a straightforward method that creates magnetic skyrmions under ambient room conditions The achievement brings skyrmions a step closer for use in real world data storage as well as other novel magnetic and electronic technologies If you have a passing familiarity with particle physics you might expect skyrmions to be particles after all they sound a lot like fermions a class of particles that includes protons and neutrons But skyrmions are not fundamental pieces of matter not even of yogurt they are effects named after the physicist who proposed them Until just recently magnetic skyrmions had only been seen at very low temperatures and under powerful magnetic fields The magnetic force in each individual atom in a magnet what physicists call their magnetic moments all line up the same way like tiny compasses all pointing in the same direction But under extreme conditions certain magnetic materials such as MnSi or FeCoSi can instead develop spots where the moments curve and twist forming a winding ring like configuration These unusual objects possess an elasticity that protects them from outside influence meaning the data they store would not be corrupted easily even by stray magnetic fields or physical defects within the material As a result magnetic skyrmions present a promising basis for information memory systems and other nanoelectronic devices A hurdle in using traditional skyrmions was the extreme lab conditions needed to form them Until recently scientists glimpsed magnetic skyrmions only at low temperatures While NIST s Dustin Gilbert was a graduate student in Kai Liu s lab at the University of California Davis he and Liu not only designed an approach to make the quantum objects but also their creations remained stable at room temperature with no magnetic field It took a trip to NIST to confirm the skyrmions existence Creating them involves placing arrays of tiny magnetized cobalt disks atop a thin film made of cobalt and palladium the NIST Center for Neutron Research NCNR had just developed a state of art polarized neutron reflectometer that was well suited to study their lab results Working with NCNR scientists the team used neutrons to see through the disk to spot the skyrmions underneath The team also captured images of the whirling configurations in the disk array at NIST s Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology CNST and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory According to Gilbert the findings should interest anyone following spintronics a field that aims to use magnetic effects such as those skyrmions exhibit for information storage and processing The idea that has been discussed is that for example you could just push these stable magnetic bundles in single file down a line and read their data The advantage here is that you d need way less power to push them around than any other method proposed for spintronics says Gilbert who recently began a postdoctoral fellowship at the NCNR What we need to do next is figure out how to make them move around But for now we can start exploring how we might use skyrmions in technology the playground is open National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Journal Reference

BANGKOK A proposal by Thailand s junta for a single Internet gateway to allow authorities to monitor content would destroy competition and was reminiscent of the most authoritarian measures to stifle free speech a former information minister said on Thursday The plan to create a single gateway for all Internet traffic was approved by the military government in August but details remain unclear Free speech activists say the gateway referred to as a China style Great Firewall is the latest effort by the junta to smother dissent and monitor detractors The plan has also triggered concern that Internet speeds would plummet which would almost certainly hurt online business and anger Internet users Once it becomes a single gateway there will be a problem with traffic speeds said Anudith Nakornthap a former information minister under the government of ousted Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra The junta wants to control various websites This is similar to the control mechanisms of non democratic countries such as China and North Korea The junta has ruled Thailand since overthrowing Yingluck s government in May Thai politics has been agitated for a decade by a confrontation between the Shinawatras in particular Yingluck s brother Thaksin Shinawatra a populist premier who was himself ousted in a coup and the royalist military establishment which sees him as a threat The military has ruled strictly since taking over banning protests and not tolerating dissent and has shut down thousands of websites Thailand has Internet gateways run by both private and state owned companies The plan would apparently entail merging traffic through one state run firm Prasong Ruangsirikulchai executive director of the Telecommunications Association of Thailand said the government would meet fierce opposition from the private companies that would be forced to suspend their lines If the government is not so strong they cannot do that Prasong said during a talk at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand on Wednesday They would have a tough time to convince private companies to cut their lines The military has said the plan is necessary for national security but Prime Minister Prayuth Chan ocha told reporters on Thursday it would not go ahead if it violated rights If it violates rights we can t do it he said Critics say the plan goes against a digital economy master plan to encourage online business by attracting investment from companies like Facebook Inc which opened its first Thai office last month The government played down a coordinated attack last week on several state websites in a protest against the plan Additional reporting by Aukkarapon Niyomyat Editing by Robert Birsel

Madonna Margaret Thatcher and Donald Trump all claim to have thrived on four hours or less of sleep If it s good enough for the queen of pop and the Iron Lady should entrepreneurs be worried about aiming for that magic eight hours a night While the National Sleep Foundation recommends adults sleep a minimum of seven hours historical evidence suggests this hasn t always been the case Extensive research pdf by historian Roger Ekirch shows humans have traditionally slept in two phases In his book At Day s Close Night in Times Past he points to more than references from historical texts that speak of dividing the night into two periods of sleep It appears it was common for humans to go to bed two hours after dusk wake in the middle of the night for a couple of hours to smoke talk pray or even have sex then go back to sleep until morning It wasn t until the th century that people began sleeping in one block Try a new sleep pattern When entrepreneur Ryan Farley co founder of US business Lawnstarter heard about biphasic sleeping he was intrigued He and business partner Steven Corcoran were struggling to get enough sleep while trying to launch the company so wondered whether sandwiching a couple of hours work between two sleep cycles would make them more productive and efficient They needed distraction free time to work on coding the website and business development time for meetings and phone calls Farley says We slept two times per night about three hours each doing the programming in between those periods of sleep when it was quiet and there was nobody there to distract us He found that adjusting his sleeping pattern in this way allowed him to start each working period daytime and night with a fresh mind Farley admits he didn t like waking up each time but says once he was awake he felt great They had to stop the pattern after a while because as the business grew they had too much to do during the daytime But could biphasic sleeping be a short term solution for other busy entrepreneurs Sleep experts advise against working during the night But Kathryn Pinkman a sleep therapist at The Insomnia Clinic in Nottingham says aiming for an eight hour sleep target could cause unnecessary stress You d be better off getting six hours of quality sleep than eight hours of fractured sleep she says Find the amount of sleep that suits you and stick to it It s about quality of sleep not quantity Kaan Aydogmus founder of London based design and communication agency Magnetic gets just five to six hours sleep a night if he s lucky The demands of running a global business that operates across different time zones means he is often jet lagged from travel or waking up at the crack of dawn for international conference calls I love my job but at the same time I am aware that the lack of sleep is becoming a problem he says I have to have my morning coffee to be able to function but then I just crack on I am trying to find ways to manage it because if I don t it is going to be full blown insomnia Most entrepreneurs have at some point struggled to get enough quality sleep but with insomnia a leading cause of lost productivity what can sleepless small business owners do to get a good night s rest and improve their performance during the day Wind down According to The Sleep Council a non profit organisation that aims to help people improve their sleeping habits it s important to spend time unwinding before going to bed That might include taking a bath listening to music or reading a book As well trying more unusual ways to relax such as walking barefoot in the garden an exercise which some early studies claim not only reduces stress but can boost overall health Aydogmus has found meditation particularly helpful in calming the mind before bed time Mindfulness a Buddhist meditation practice that involves focusing concentration on a particular word or sound to achieve a relaxed non judgmental awareness of your thoughts feelings and sensations has been found to help fight insomnia and improve quality of sleep Sleep and dream expert Charlie Morley teaches mindfulness as a tool to helping people sleep more easily He suggest to minutes of mindfulness meditation before bed to bridge the gap between wakefulness and sleep It s also important to go to bed feeling tired avoid the temptation to go to bed early says Pinkman By going to bed a little later you will increase your appetite for sleep The larger your appetite she says the better chance you have for going to sleep quickly and sleeping through the night Pinkman explains Fractured sleep is more likely if you are going to bed too early You wake up feeling frustrated and before you know it you associate that emotion with being in your bed and that becomes a habit It s also important to stick to a regular wake up time she adds so set your alarm for the same time every morning Switch off Smartphones and tablets mean many entrepreneurs now take their work to bed with them Instead Aydogmus chooses to go to bed the old fashioned way resisting the temptation to check emails or watch late night television in favour of reading a good book Part of the problem is the artificial blue light these gadgets emit Exposure to this before bedtime suppresses the production of the sleep inducing hormone melatonin Dan Gandesha chief executive of crowdfunding platform Property Partner admits juggling a business with raising a six month old baby that needs attention throughout the night has taken its toll on his sleep While he leaves his phone on at night

CLEVELAND Ohio The Port of Cleveland has taken a big step toward solving its expensive dredging responsibilities announcing today that it sold its first load of Cuyahoga River sediment to a construction company Great Lakes Construction Co bought the equivalent of dump truck loads of sediment from the Port and its partner the Kurtz Bros landscaping company for use in the Ohio Department of Transportation s Lakeland Boulevard project in Euclid Port President and CEO Will Friedman said the sediment sale demonstrates that a market exists for the reconstituted waste product When our studies determined the port could turn sediment from waste into a useful product while also reducing public expense and advancing green sustainable practices we ran with it said Friedman The Great Lakes Construction ODOT project is a great example of how sediment can be used and we re looking forward to more companies seeing the benefits of the product Under terms of the partnership the Cleveland Cuyahoga County Port Authority pays Kurtz Bros of Independence per cubic yard to trap and sell sludge dredged from the Cuyahoga River Kurtz Bros keeps percent of all sales while the port keeps the rest Each year the U S Army Corps of Engineers dredges more than cubic yards of sediment from the river to keep it deep enough for large commercial ships to navigate the six miles from Lake Erie to the ArcelorMittal steel mill In years past the dredged sediment was treated as waste and dumped into confined disposal dikes on the lakefront The port determined that capturing and recycling the sediment before it settled into the river bottom could provide financial benefits by selling it for such beneficial uses as composting and road fill As a cost saving measure the Army Corps had proposed dumping the sediment directly into Lake Erie But the Ohio EPA refused to approve the plan saying the sediment was too polluted to dump in open water

percent owning the collection and dissemination of data is high priority For example tryng to use and update an excel spreadsheet is nearly impossible with formulas consistently being broken or individuals citing information from outdated versions Agencies need to ensure data is collected and held in a secure governed environment and decisions are made based on the same set of data collected The need for self service access and visualization of data Traditional business intelligence systems restrict the agility required to make decisions quickly Thirty four percent of respondents said

By KARIN LAUB and JOSEF FEDERMAN Associated Press JERUSALEM AP The fate of a Palestinian boy seized center stage Thursday in the battle of narratives accompanying the recent burst of deadly Israeli Palestinian violence Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ignited an uproar in Israel after falsely claiming in a televised speech that Israelis had summarily executed Ahmed Manasra when the year old actually was recovering at an Israeli hospital after he stabbed two Israelis including a boy his own age Palestinians in turn were enraged by video showing Ahmed lying in the street his head bloodied and his legs splayed as bystanders curse him and shout Die in Hebrew The images widely circulated on social media made no mention of the preceding attack by Ahmed and his cousin Hassan who was then shot and killed by police Monday The case has become a lightning rod for both sides Israel has repeatedly accused Abbas of fomenting violence with what it says are incendiary comments Now we have a new big lie That new big lie is that Israel is executing Palestinians Netanyahu said Thursday Still he said he would be perfectly open to meeting Abbas to address what the Israeli leader said was a wave of incitement Abbas who has long argued that armed attacks on Israelis go against Palestinian interests has denied the Israeli allegations that he is fomenting unrest He did not immediately respond to Netanyahu s offer In his speech Wednesday Abbas said Israel has engaged in excessive force and the summary execution of our children in cold blood The high level name calling highlighted the abyss between the two leaders at a time when prospects for a return to Israeli Palestinian negotiations appear nil In the past month eight Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks most of them stabbings During the same period Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire including labeled by Israel as attackers and the others in clashes between stone throwers and Israeli troops Israel has increased security across the country in response to the unrest On Thursday the military said it would deploy soldiers in Jerusalem to help police maintain order guard public transportation and the city s main streets Both sides use social media to promote their official narratives Israeli officials have released security camera videos of the attacks sometimes within minutes The police army Foreign Ministry and prime minister s office cooperate collecting clips from Palestinian websites that are seen as promoting violence or searching for Facebook posts from assailants that they say indicated they were about to commit violent acts Foreign Ministry spokesman Emanuel Nahshon said the strategy is to spread Israel s messages and complain to popular services about allegedly offensive comment He said Israel persuaded Google s YouTube service and Facebook to remove several Palestinian videos Palestinian authorities meanwhile have focused on releasing amateur video appearing to show Israeli police using excessive force The battle also plays out in private Facebook Twitter and Instagram accounts On the Palestinian side social media play a growing role in the conflict Palestinian media experts say the vast majority of Palestinians between the ages of and use social media For the young social media have taken the place of political factions that were key to organizing major bouts of fighting with Israel in the past In this round of violence Palestinian attacks on Israelis have largely been carried out by individuals with no ties to militant groups Motives often remain murky but relatives of assailants have cited as potential triggers both the pressures of life under Israeli occupation and videos seen on social media Israeli Facebook users meanwhile have been sharing a wide array of posts during the unrest including videos on how to defend themselves against stabbers as well as the clips of attacks on Israelis Some Israelis accuse the media of anti Israel bias or express anti Arab sentiment while others call for coexistence Among Palestinians the video of the wounded Ahmed Manasra has perhaps had the biggest emotional impact In the video the terrified boy is seen lying between the tracks of Jerusalem s light rail his legs at a twisted angle after having been struck by a car in the wake of the stabbing attack As Israeli officers stand nearby voices are heard presumably those of bystanders shouting at the boy in Hebrew and Arabic Just shoot this son of a bitch in the head one man says in Hebrew Some policemen appear to be trying to push away those yelling at the boy On Tuesday the Palestinian Information Ministry posted the video on YouTube with subtitles in English under the title Ahmed Manasra Israeli brutality exposed Israel responded by announcing the boy was alive and being treated at Hadassah Hospital On Wednesday Israel released security camera video that appears to show the two Manasra cousins wielding knives and chasing a man through a Jewish area of east Jerusalem The video moves to a shot of an Israeli boy standing in a candy store getting on his bicycle then collapsing and falling off the bike after the stabbing In a final scene Hassan is seen being confronted by two armed policemen along the light rail track He lunges at the officers and is shot Abbas made the next move in a televised speech Wednesday evening We will not give in to the logic of brute force and policies of occupation and aggression practiced by the Israeli government and its herds of settlers who engage in terrorism against our people and our holy places and our homes and our trees and the summary execution of our children in cold blood as they did with the child Ahmed Manasra and other children in Jerusalem and other places he said The comments aimed at a domestic audience appeared to be an attempt to catch up with Palestinian public opinion Abbas faces mounting criticism at home that he is too conciliatory toward Israel Behind the scenes Abbas has been urging his security commanders to clamp down on violence saying attacks on Israelis counter Palestinian interests Abbas aide Saeb Erekat said Abbas comments about Ahmed Manasra were a result of inaccurate information We thought in the beginning that he was killed Erekat said Then the information we had was that he is clinically dead There appeared to be no attempt by Abbas office to set the record straight Instead it accused Israel of inciting against the Palestinian leader Erekat said Abbas was trying to underscore claims that Israel is wrongfully killing Palestinians being accused of carrying out attacks There could have been many ways to arrest those people but they chose to shoot in order to kill and this is what happened in many cases he said Nine human rights groups in Israel expressed concern Wednesday over what they said has been a worrying trend to use firearms to kill Palestinians who have attacked Israelis or are suspected of such attacks The groups said that politicians and senior police officers have openly called for the extrajudicial killing of suspects The U S has also expressed concerns that Israel may have used excessive force in subduing some of the attackers a claim Netanyahu rejected He said Israel is using exactly the kind and amount of legitimate force that any other government faced with seemingly spontaneous stabbing attacks would use Associated Press writer Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah contributed to this report Copyright The Associated Press This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

Submitted by admin on AM Companies mentioned in this article Omidyar Network REDWOOD CITY Calif Oct PRNewswire Omidyar Network today released Big Data Small Credit The Digital Revolution and Its Impact on Emerging Market Consumers a research report that analyzes a new category of technology enterprises that are disrupting the traditional way of assessing consumer credit risk in emerging markets Using non financial data such as social media activity and mobile phone usage patterns complex algorithms and big data analytics are delivering a quicker cheaper and more effective credit assessment of consumers who lack credit histories and were invisible to lenders before The financial services industry is on the brink of a new era where harnessing the power of digital information to serve new segments is becoming the new normal said Mike Kubzansky partner at Omidyar Network Companies in the Big Data Small Credit space are an example of how this paradigm shift can unlock an entire new pool of customers for formal lenders while helping consumers in emerging markets get the services they need to improve their lives The report explores how the digital revolution and the resulting explosion of data have converged to significantly enlarge the addressable consumer credit market for traditional and alternative lenders in developing markets In India alone this new approach to risk assessment can potentially bring between and million new customers to the consumer credit market which would mean tripling the current addressable market for retail lenders in the country Big Data Small Credit also delves into the opportunities and challenges ahead for these new businesses It shares the results of an in depth consumer survey with early adopters in Kenya and Colombia by exploring pressing questions around privacy and trust and provides recommendations to key stakeholders on how to reap the benefits of this new evolving field Listening to the early adopter consumer is at the crux of realizing the potential of the Big Data Small Credit business said Arjuna Costa investment partner at Omidyar Network Our survey shows that consumers in emerging markets have a clear understanding of the privacy tradeoffs this type of solution entails and seven out of are willing to share information they consider private in order to get a loan The consumer survey found that early adopters can articulate differentiate between and rank different types of private information They are also younger stably employed and more educated and tech savvy than the average population of both surveyed countries an attractive consumer segment for any lender However when faced with emergencies and cash flow challenges the large majority still resort to an informal source percent of respondents in Kenya and percent in Colombia go to family and friends for loans percent of respondents in Kenya and percent in Colombia use other informal credit sources such as pawnshops loan sharks etc While the report indicates that it is still early days for this new business and most providers are still experimenting with algorithms models and data sources both the economic and social benefits of this approach can already be ascertained In the world s six biggest emerging economies China Brazil India Mexico Indonesia and Turkey this new technology has the potential to help between and million people gain access to formal credit for the first time However in order to capitalize on this opportunity the report recommends a concerted industry effort to build an ecosystem in which these enterprises can continue to develop In particular it encourages incumbents in the financial services sector to enhance their existing risk assessment platforms with these new technologies and advises policymakers to balance the need for consumer protection with the imperative to not regulate this nascent industry too soon As part of its financial inclusion initiative Omidyar Network has been a long time investor in solutions directed at reducing the high cost of credit assessment in emerging markets including early stage investments in pioneering companies in the space such as Lenddo

Millennials don t even know what cybersecurity is By Zach Noble Oct Today s young people are dubbed tech savvy because they grew up with smartphones Maybe the label doesn t fit A survey of nearly young adults worldwide commissioned by Raytheon and the National Cyber Security Alliance NCSA revealed a mix of misplaced confidence and startling ignorance among the to year old respondents when it comes to their online security The survey conducted by Zogby Analytics polled young adults in a dozen countries Results were similar across most regions while the Middle East bucked some trends In general women were less savvy than men One big result percent of respondents said they believe they can stay safe online But that confidence is coupled with apparent apathy and ignorance Fifty eight percent of respondents said they were not taught how to stay safe online or they weren t sure if they d been taught Internet security in school Sixty seven percent of respondents said they hadn t heard about any cyberattacks in the past year The survey was conducted from July to Aug in the wake of the Office of Personnel Management breach the Target breach and many other high profile cyber incidents It wasn t all bravado Plenty of respondents said they weren t interested in pursuing a cybersecurity career because they didn t think they had the right skills American women were three times as likely as men to say they weren t interested in cybersecurity work Much of that lack of interest might have to do with role models and education percent of U S men and percent of U S women respondents said they d never had a teacher or counselor mention cybersecurity as a career option We need to change the language NCSA Executive Director Michael Kaiser said pointing out that respondents were more likely to respond positively when they were asked if they d like to help protect the Internet than if they were asked if they d like to work in cybersecurity Respondents also indicated that they weren t sure about career paths in cybersecurity a response Ben Scribner program director for national cybersecurity professionalization and workforce development at the Department of Homeland Security chalked up to the fact that the current generation is on the bleeding edge of establishing the cybersecurity profession The developing National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework might be one tangible step toward defining the profession But Kaiser Scribner and Business Higher Education Forum CEO Brian Fitzgerald also pointed to the need to simply get the word out Not all cybersecurity professionals must be graduates of four year colleges with science or engineering degrees Fitzgerald said Instead the cybersecurity field will need people with diverse skill sets and government and industry alike should be sending that message The rest of the world The U S isn t exactly leading on cybersecurity education In the survey respondents from the Middle East were much more likely to say they d had cybersecurity education had spoken with a practicing professional and had a teacher or counselor recommend the profession to them The three countries that made up the survey s Middle East component were Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Qatar which are smaller and more tech enabled than many other Middle Eastern nations Kaiser praised European countries particularly Estonia for building web fluent societies that the U S could emulate Noticeably absent from the survey were Latin America and Africa along with American cyber rivals Russia and China As the U S works to bolster cybersecurity awareness and education Kaiser said the survey results demonstrate that the cyber challenge is a global issue Our economies are interlocked he said We need them to be secure in order to do business with them About the Author Zach Noble is a staff writer covering cloud big data and workforce issues Connect with him on Twitter thezachnoble

Comments I am an old movie nut I especially like old westerns I watched the movie Fort Apache the other night It stars John Wayne Henry Fonda and Shirley Temple to name a few I couldn t help but notice as I always do with all old westerns that the movie had hundreds of Indians but none of them were fat Why is that If you are a bowhunter you already know the answer Even today with ultra light compound bows lightning fast carbon arrows super sharp expanding broadheads camouflage scent eliminating clothing cover scents and hundreds of bowhunting gadgets designed to increase your odds killing a deer can be a pretty tough deal Wouldn t you hate to know whether or not you eat depended on your bowhunting success Incredibly the Native Americans did find success Nearly every Native American tribe including tribes in Alabama used some form of bow and arrow as a weapon for hunting Even though we think of the bows and arrows used by Alabama tribes as primitive think progressive technology They were much better than the bows and arrows used by the Native Americans years before them Bows as hunting weapons date to the Stone Age Some arrowheads discovered in America have been dated to be years old Arrowheads have been discovered among the bones of extinct animals such as the wooly mammoth Native Americans had thousands of years to improve the technology Like the bowhunters of today each generation of Native Americans improved on the archery technology that their forefathers used They learned to use stronger wood bows capable of shooting faster and longer distances They learned to wrap their bows with sinew to make them stronger They built faster and stronger arrow shafts and more streamlined broadheads eventually capable of shooting clear through a deer Just as today the deer s nose was a major obstacle to taking a deer with a bow and arrow in those days Native Americans eventually learned to cover their bodies in river mud to cover their scent Native Anericans shot bows and arrows to survive They had a lot of time to sit around and think about making their equipment better We tend to think of the longbows re curves and original compound bows that our grandfathers used as ancient technology I suspect the Native Americans felt the same way about the bows and arrows that their grandfathers used If you are a a bowhunter you spend a lot of hours in a tree thinking I think about the Native Americans on occasion and how they may have once hunted the same patch of land and what they had to hunt with and what I have to hunt with What they accomplished is downright impressive Mike Bolton is editor of Alabama Outdoor News He can be reached at aloutdoors aol com

After five years of development and about tests worldwide the smartphone powered eye test devices developed by MIT spinout EyeNetra is coming to hospitals optometric clinics optical stores and even homes nationwide But on the heels of its commercial release EyeNetra says it s been pursuing opportunities to collaborate with virtual reality companies seeking to use the technology to develop vision corrected virtual reality displays As much as we want to solve the prescription glasses market we could also help bring virtual reality to the masses says EyeNetra co founder Ramesh Raskar an associate professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab who co invented the device The device called Netra is a plastic binocular like headset Users attach a smartphone with the startup s app to the front and peer through the headset at the phone s display Patterns such as separate red and green lines or circles appear on the screen The user turns a dial to align the patterns and pushes a button to lock them in place After eight interactions the app calculates the difference between what the user sees as aligned and the actual alignment of the patterns This signals any refractive errors such as nearsightedness farsightedness and astigmatism The app then displays the refractive powers axis of astigmatism and pupillary distance required for eyeglasses prescriptions Ramesh Raskar holding the Netra device Credit John Werner Camera Culture Group In April the startup launched Blink an on demand refractive test service in New York where employees bring the startup s optometry tools including the Netra device to people s homes and offices In India EyeNetra has launched Nayantara a similar program to provide low cost eye tests to the poor and uninsured in remote villages far from eye doctors Both efforts used EyeNetra s suite of tools now available for eye care providers worldwide According to the World Health Organization uncorrected refractive errors are the world s second highest cause of blindness EyeNetra originally invented the device for the developing world specifically for poor and remote regions of Africa and Asia where many people can t find health care easily India alone has around million people in need of eyeglasses But the United States has offered the best market in terms of adoption Raskar says The consumerization of health is happening much faster here in the U S than in the developing world he says If you re to play that role of smartphone based personalized health solutions then we have an amazing lead over anyone else Personalized Correction Over the past six months EyeNetra has been in discussion with virtual reality companies to integrate the technology into virtual reality displays Raskar says The idea he says is to use the startup s technology to develop custom screens to fit a user s eyeglass prescription Prescription screens could make virtual reality devices more form fitting for a more immersive and comfortable experience Raskar says Right now devices are built with extra space on the viewing end for people wearing glasses But it could also help solve a larger issue aligning the eye lens prescription lens and the virtual reality screen All three have to be aligned in the right way for you to enjoy the experience Raskar says If the glasses shift for instance optical aberrations disrupt the viewing potentially causing headache fatigue and nausea EyeNetra s technology measures how a user s optical refractive errors will affect how they see patterns on a digital display in an environment very similar to a virtual reality headset Raskar says Therefore companies could use these precise measurements to display images that are pre corrected to a user s specific refraction errors It s personalized correction Raskar says Your vision correction is built into the headset Vitor Pamplona Credit John Werner Camera Culture Group Such an approach could be game changing Raskar says as billions of dollars have recently been invested into virtual reality technology In Facebook acquired Oculus Rift for billion Google and other big companies recently backed Magic Leap with more than million and Microsoft has starting pooling resources into virtual reality research In addition to the major business EyeNetra is doing for prescriptions it can also disrupt virtual reality which is potentially an even bigger market Raskar says User Friendly Optics Around Raskar and some of his Media Lab students developed a prototype of Netra A small plastic device was clipped to a smartphone and viewers used the phone s keyboard to align the patterns The device was designed as an inverse of a traditional Shack Hartmann wavefront sensor machine which shines a laser into the patient s eye and measures the refracted light with a photon sensor to find optical aberrations that affect eyesight Essentially Netra replaces the expensive sensor with a smartphone display Because the red and green light goes through different parts of the eye aligning the two colors similarly demonstrates any optical aberrations Later that year Raskar and EyeNetra co founder and chief technology officer Vitor Pamplona who co invented the technology brought the invention to MAS Imaging and Fabrication Ventures a class he co teaches that presents image based projects for students to further innovate There teams of students ran the device through several case studies researched markets and established a network of investors Over the next few months Raskar Pamplona and other students entered the prototype in MIT s IDEAS competition where they won a prize and the MIT K Business Plan Competition where they earned a spot as semifinalists Then a grant from the MIT Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation officially launched the entrepreneurial effort in But we realized we had to start all over again Raskar says This meant a complete redesign of the product and business plan to focus less on the technology and more on market need As much as we wanted to be disruptive in long run the reality of the world was that we had to work with really good partners he says EyeNetra teamed up with the LV Prasad Eye Institute and Lotus Eye Institute and Hospital among other clinical partners to help conduct tens of thousands of tests worldwide About product iterations led to an improved device and better user interface For instance around three years ago the team realized that people didn t perform well interacting with the phone So for the current design they moved all buttons and knobs to the actual device That change and other small tweaks made the device easier and more widely used Raskar says We were naive in thinking that if you solve the optics problem it will be good But in reality there are three parameters the machine and its optical design the eye and its involuntary activities and the human perception he says Getting all those right in the same design is nontrivial Moving forward Raskar says EyeNetra aims to capitalize on the consumerization of health phenomenon in the United States where consumers are gaining access to innovative medical tools for

and then frankly I think you need to sit down and put a doctor to the test Greer said Boy my friends aren t going to like that That s because Greer s view runs counter to a storm of protest over what some physicians view as burdensome rules for maintaining board certification which is like a Good Housekeeping Seal for doctors signaling expertise in a specialty Philadelphia s American Board of Internal Medicine has been the focal point for the uproar partly because it is the largest of the boards that certify physicians but also because last year it botched the introduction of an expanded certification process decried by many as paper pushing busy work not worth the time and money We simply didn t have a smooth pathway for doctors to show us their work said Richard Baron a longtime Mount Airy primary care physician who became chief executive of the internal medicine board in June For example doctors had to manually input data from patient records into the board s system to get certification credit Physician dissent led to the start of a tiny competitor the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons in San Diego which has certified about doctors this year The issue is critical for patients because board certification is supposed to be one of the best ways to identify the most effective doctors Yet passing the test has never been shown to denote a better performing physician Where did the internal medicine board go wrong Lois Margaret Nora CEO of the American Board of Medical Specialties cited the breadth of the internal medicine board which offers certificates in subspecialties It tried to create a program that would fit the entire specialty of internal medicine she said Much of the pushback has come from cardiologists pulmonologists and gastroenterologists who are saying Wait a minute That doesn t fit well enough with who I am and what I do Nora said Gregory Kane a pulmonologist at Jefferson who has three certifications from the internal medicine board and has helped write tests said constant changes were a problem Until doctors had to pass one test and were certified for life Then doctors had to pass a high stakes exam every years but recently the rules for staying certified have become ever more complicated Kane said That was especially true with new requirements including a patient survey that took effect last year Suddenly the anger reflected back at the ABIM Kane said The ABIM didn t listen at first and the anger intensified like a boil under the skin With doctors holding of its certificates the ABIM is far from crumbling It is by far the largest of the boards that operate under the American Board of Medical Specialities which is based in Chicago and sets guidelines for member boards Physician certification is a business in the Philadelphia area where five specialty boards including the one for internal medicine are located The other local boards cover surgery ophthalmology and plastic surgery as well as allergy and immunology None faced the same backlash as the ABIM which this year suspended parts of its new certification regime while it makes them more palatable That led to fierce debates in the trade press about what doctors need to do to stay current It s hard to understand how this is all going to settle out It s so emotionally laden said Jeptha Curtis an associate professor at Yale University School of Medicine who cowrote a recent study showing that a doctor s board certification does not ensure better outcomes for certain cardiac procedures We are being judged more rigorously and more often than ever he said Then we re being asked to pay to be judged What is clear is that the broad push by hospitals insurers and government to measure the performance and the quality of doctors is unlikely to end Measuring quality is the Holy Grail of medicine right now but the profession s grasp of how to do it is primitive said Curtis who has two internal medicine certifications in cardiology and generally supports the board Paul Teirstein chief of cardiology for Scripps Clinic in Southern California is among the leaders opposing the new regime The doctors are upset because they are pushing us very hard to do all this what we think is busy work said Teirstein who also helped establish the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons Requirements for this board include initial certification from another specialty board and hours of education within two years of certification The internal medicine requirements must be met over a year cycle Among hospitals or systems accepting credentials from the upstart board is St Mary Medical Center in Langhorne Richard Leshner a St Mary cardiologist and former medical staff president led that effort A so called grandfather he was certified for life until last year s changes Leshner says education is enough to keep doctors current I look at lawyers Do they take the bar every years Others don t trust classwork without a test That s a terrible idea because there needs to be some level of accountability that the CME was meaningful said Mike Renzi who has a family practice in Haddon Heights Renzi said a high stakes test every years is a good way to ensure that there s a baseline level of knowledge competency but parts of the process feel like a paper push Greer the Paoli doctor has another reason to support certification beyond improving his practice The people I interact with and send patients to I want to know that their certification is up to date he said hbrubaker phillynews com InqBrubaker

Business union and community leaders have come away from a meeting with Malcolm Turnbull in a positive mood The gathering with the prime minister was described as a mini summit but it was more a case of the new government leadership listening to key stakeholders about the options to lift economic growth and create jobs Treasurer Scott Morrison and Assistant Treasurer Kelly O Dwyer were also present No firm decisions were taken at the three hour meeting a follow up to a privately sponsored reform gathering in August but neither has anything been taken off the table particularly regarding tax reform Business Council of Australia chief Jennifer Westacott lauded it as an outstanding meeting and a mature conversation that aimed to keep the community on board with much needed reforms It isn t about taking stuff off the table and narrowing the options she told reporters after the meeting Australian Industry Group chief Innes Willox described the meeting as one step in a process There will be continued engagement with government over this and we are all very encouraged by that he told reporters ACTU secretary Dave Oliver said that while there were differences between the groups there were also many areas of commonality We all have one thing in common and that is it is all about growth he said Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said it was always useful for governments to be engaging with a broad cross section of society But held at this stage of the cycle is evidence that the last two years has been a wasted opportunity he told AAP CPA Australia boss Alex Malley a strong critic of the government leadership under Tony Abbott was disappointed that Mr Turnbull was relying on the eight attendees at the meeting as an apparent proxy for a balanced community representation It is not possible to have an informed summit in relation to the economy without strategic and precise input from taxation and superannuation experts he said The International Monetary Fund has released its annual assessment of Australia saying declining investment in mining and a sharp fall in the terms of trade are posing challenges after a strong performance over the past two decades Continued efforts to support aggregate demand and raise productivity will be critical in transitions to a broader based and high growth path the IMF said It expects the economy to grow from per cent this year to three per cent in close to its long term average But the Washington based institution says that while the level of interest rates is appropriately accommodative they may need to be cut further if the rebound disappoints

GaN diodes with high current operations and a low turn on voltage September Panasonic Corporation today announced that it developed gallium nitride GaN diodes that can not only operate at a high current that is four times greater than that tolerated by conventional silicon carbide SiC diodes but also operate at low voltages by virtue of their low turn on voltage Production of the new diodes was made possible via a newly developed hybrid structure composed of of separately embedded structure comprised of a low voltage unit and a high current capable unit in preparation for high voltage conditions Conventional silicon Si diodes are limited with regard to reducing switching losses On the other hand diodes based on SiC a compound that is considered as a promising next generation power semiconductor as well as GaN require an increased chip area to achieve high current operations thus posing limitations on the reduction of switching losses and size owing to increased operating frequencies The newly produced GaN diodes have achieved simultaneous high current operations and low threshold voltage and thus can handle high currents even with a small chip area The capacitance of the chip can therefore be reduced to achieve lower switching losses allowing the device to operate at higher frequencies As a result use of GaN diodes in the voltage conversion circuits or inverter circuits of automotive or industrial equipment that requires high power can reduce system size due to high frequency operation This newly developed product has the following advantages High current

Image Gallery images The first Moto was arguably the best of the first wave of Android Wear watches but it also wasn t without its flaws battery life being the biggest Let s see if Motorola improved on the nd gen Moto in enough ways to make it a smart buy The first Moto not only had sketchy battery life but it also had a few other issues its ambient display wasn t an always on display it was more like a half the time on display if not a bit less it looked pretty damn big on men s wrists and looked ridiculously oversized for most women its display wasn t completely round with a cut off point at the bottom that became lovingly or something like that known as the flat tire This nd gen Moto fixes all but one of those issues It has much better battery life a display that can stay on all the time while still lasting all day long and you can also now buy it in a smaller size Motorola must still be waiting for AAA to arrive though as the flat tire still hasn t been fixed At this point it looks like the flat bottom of its display was a deliberate design choice all along rather than an engineering compromise since other smartwatch manufacturers like LG Samsung and Huawei have had no problem making smartwatches with fully round displays It doesn t bother us too much and in a way it s a good fit for Android Wear which slides cards up from the bottom of the screen The display s horizontal bottom matches the horizontal tops on those cards Though it looks a bit strange having clock faces cut off at the bottom especially ones with light colored clocks we did get used to the unique look and don t think it s a deal breaker There is one functional advantage tied to the flat tire display Motorola put an ambient light sensor in that little black void below the screen which opens the door to an auto brightness setting something we haven t seen on other Android Wear watches Given the choice we d prefer the Huawei Watch s fully round display over the Moto s auto brightness but it does become a key point of differentiation between two watches that are otherwise pretty close to being identical By the way we reviewed the smaller of the two nd gen Moto s this is the mm model you see and there s also a mm one the same diameter as the st gen Moto Having two sizes gives customers more choice but we think they re a bit off This mm model looks what I d call just right on my male wrist Unfortunately this size is also what you get in the women s models where it s going to look pretty big We would have preferred this mm model to be the larger one sitting alongside a smaller model maybe around mm like the smaller Apple Watch As it stands now the nd gen Moto is still much more of a men s watch in regular and large options than it is a unisex watch for many women s wrists the two sizes are more like big and obscenely huge Despite having an IPS display the new Moto has good battery life not far off the best Android Wear offers even with its always on clock setting turned on Before getting our hands on the review unit we were a little worried about this since AMOLED screens make more sense in wearables black parts of the screen don t fire any pixels on AMOLED so dark clock faces don t drain much juice But alas nothing to worry about here Using the Moto every day with its always on display setting turned on brightness set to percent regular notifications coming in and using the occasional voice control it dropped on average percent per hour That s only a little behind the AMOLED Huawei Watch which dropped between and percent per hour under the same conditions Now once we turned auto brightness on the Moto s results were closer to the Huawei Watch s But auto brightness does have one annoying flaw when wearing long sleeves the Moto is naturally going to slip at least partially under the sleeve At that point auto brightness thinks you re in a dark room and dims its display accordingly That doesn t matter while your arm is hanging at your side but once you actually want to read something on the watch it takes a few seconds to brighten up hardly the end of the world we know but just annoying enough to make auto brightness presumably the main reason Motorola stuck with this strange flat tire design in the first place not worth bothering with Because of this we prefer to just leave the brightness set to or percent both of which work well under most lighting conditions Apart from the new smaller size options the Moto s design hasn t changed dramatically from last year s model It does add those prominent lugs you see above which give it a slightly different look on the original the casing met the band directly with no lugs in between It s also a hair thinner than the st gen Moto At mm inch thick the new model isn t alarmingly beefy but it s also noticeably thicker than many regular timekeeping watches As you can see we reviewed the leather band model and the band has two nifty features you can easily remove both sides of the band by pulling on a couple of little sliders and its holes are pretty close together Who cares about the holes Well on other leather band smartwatches we ve reviewed the leather stretches out a bit over time and the farther apart the holes are the harder it is to find just the right fit If you wear the watch too loosely you might not feel vibrations when notifications come in Wear it too tightly and well you probably like having blood circulating to your hand Speaking of vibrations the new Moto falls on the lighter end of the scale We often miss incoming alerts despite wearing the watch fairly snugly It s a tough balancing act with this if the vibrations are too powerful customers will complain that they re annoying them But we think Motorola could have afforded to add just a bit more oomph to its alerts or better yet Google could let users choose between light and heavy vibration modes in Android Wear s settings The new Moto sits next to the Huawei Watch as your two best options on the Android Wear side of the fence We do prefer the Huawei Watch s fully round screen less lug tastic design and slightly better battery life but it does also cost a bit more Huawei s wearable starts at US compared to for the same sized Moto Both are nice looking pieces with virtually identical software experiences Motorola threw in a few of its own apps for heart rate and fitness tracking but those aren t significant enough to dictate your decision If you really want to save that you ll be happy with the Moto But if the extra cash isn t a huge deal then we do think the Huawei Watch is the overall better product The nd gen Moto is available now starting at for this mm model and starting at for the huge mm one For more on its most obvious rival you can hit up Gizmag s Huawei Watch review

New flat transistor defies theoretical limit October by Bob Yirka report Schematic diagram illustrating the cross sectional view of the ATLAS TFET with ultra thin bilayer MoS nm as the channel and degenerately doped p type Ge as the source Path for electron transport is shown by the red arrows which run vertically indicating band to band tunnelling BTBT from the Ge source to the MoS and then laterally through the MoS layers via drift diffusion to the drain As the Ge is highly doped the tunnelling barrier height is mainly determined by the effective band overlap between Ge and MoS while the tunnelling width is determined by the MoS thickness including the van der Waals gap Credit c Nature October doi nature A team of researchers with members from the University of California and Rice University has found a way to get a flat transistor to defy theoretical limitations on Field Effect Transistors FETs In their paper published in the journal Nature the team describes their work and why they believe it could lead to consumer devices that have both smaller electronics and longer battery life Katsuhiro Tomioka with Erasmus MC University Medical Center in the Netherlands offers a News Views article discussing the work done by the team in the same journal edition As Tomioka notes the materials and type of architecture currently used in creating small consumer electronic devices is rapidly reaching a threshold upon which a tradeoff will have to be made smaller transistors or more power requirements this is because of the unique nature of FETs shortening the channel they use requires more power on a logarithmic scale Thus to continue making FETs ever smaller and to get them to use less power means two things the first is that a different channel material must be found one that allow high switch on currents at low voltages The second is a way must be found to lower the voltage required for the FETs Researchers have made inroads on the first requirement building FETs with metal oxide semiconductor materials for example The second has proved to be more challenging In this latest effort the researchers looked to tunneling to reduce voltage demands the results of which are called quite naturally tunneling FETs or TFETs they require less voltage because they are covered by a gate stack and work by transporting a charge via quantum tunneling The device the team built is based on a D bilayer of molybdenum disulfide and bulk germanium it demonstrated a negative differential resistance a marker of tunneling and a very steep subthreshold slope the switching property associated with rapid turn on which fell below the classical theoretical limit The work by the team represents substantial progress in solving the minituration problem for future electronics devices but as the team notes there is still much to do They express optimism that further improvements will lead to not just better consumer devices but tiny sensors that could be introduced into the body to help monitor health More information A subthermionic tunnel field effect transistor with an atomically thin channel Nature October DOI nature Abstract The fast growth of information technology has been sustained by continuous scaling down of the silicon based metal oxide field effect transistor However such technology faces two major challenges to further scaling First the device electrostatics the ability of the transistor s gate electrode to control its channel potential are degraded when the channel length is decreased using conventional bulk materials such as silicon as the channel Recently two dimensional semiconducting materials have emerged as promising candidates to replace silicon as they can maintain excellent device electrostatics even at much reduced channel lengths The second more severe challenge is that the supply voltage can no longer be scaled down by the same factor as the transistor dimensions because of the fundamental thermionic limitation of the steepness of turn on characteristics or subthreshold swing To enable scaling to continue without a power penalty a different transistor mechanism is required to obtain subthermionic subthreshold swing such as band to band tunnelling Here we demonstrate band to band tunnel field effect transistors tunnel FETs based on a two dimensional semiconductor that exhibit steep turn on subthreshold swing is a minimum of millivolts per decade and an average of millivolts per decade for four decades of drain current at room temperature By using highly doped germanium as the source and atomically thin molybdenum disulfide as the channel a vertical heterostructure is built with excellent electrostatics a strain free heterointerface a low tunnelling barrier and a large tunnelling area Our atomically thin and layered semiconducting channel tunnel FET ATLAS TFET is the only planar architecture tunnel FET to achieve subthermionic subthreshold swing over four decades of drain current as recommended in ref and is also the only tunnel FET in any architecture to achieve this at a low power supply voltage of volts Our device is at present the thinnest channel subthermionic transistor and has the potential to open up new avenues for ultra dense and low power integrated circuits as well as for ultra sensitive biosensors and gas sensors shares

two hours with a performance by the band One Republic Apple hasn t announced a release update for a Mac software update known as El Capitan p m p m Central The new iPhones will go on sale on Sept with advance orders starting this Saturday That s a week later than Apple s typical playbook Usually new iPhones go on sale on the second Friday after their announcements Consistent with past models the iPhone s will start at with a two year service contract The iPhone s Plus will start at with a contract Last year s models will cost less The markets getting it right away are the U S Australia Canada China France Germany Hong Kong Japan New Zealand Puerto Rico Singapore and the U K Apple stakes new claim to living room shows new iPhones Tribune wire reports Apple staked a new claim to the living room on Wednesday as the maker of iPhones and other hand held gadgets unveiled an Internet TV system that s designed as a beachhead for the tech giant s broader ambitions to deliver a wide range of information games music and video to the home CEO Tim Apple staked a new claim to the living room on Wednesday as the maker of iPhones and other hand held gadgets unveiled an Internet TV system that s designed as a beachhead for the tech giant s broader ambitions to deliver a wide range of information games music and video to the home CEO Tim Tribune wire reports The base models of the new iPhones will come with gigabytes of storage even as Samsung and other phone makers are now offering gigabytes to start But for more Apple is offering gigabytes For an extra over the base prices Apple is offering gigabytes Apple announced the new iPhone details at an event Wednesday in San Francisco p m Central The new iPhones will have sharper cameras Apple says that the main camera on the iPhone s and s Plus will have a resolution of megapixels It s the first increase since when the iPhone s got megapixels compared with megapixels before But many high end Android phones have long had more Samsung phones for instance have megapixels while an upcoming Sony phone will have megapixels Apple said at an event in San Francisco Wednesday that it waited until it could ensure delivering more megapixels without image degradation Meanwhile the front camera for selfies is getting a boost to megapixels from megapixels matching Samsung s latest phones Plus the new iPhones will use the main display as a flash something the front camera now lacks And video recording will be improved to the Ultra HD or k resolution found on Samsung and Sony phones a m p m Central Apple s new iPhones come as smartphone sales are slowing worldwide given that many people already own one But researchers at IDC say that iPhone sales are growing faster than those of Android phones IDC expects iPhone shipments to grow by percent this year while it estimates Android phones will grow only percent During a presentation Wednesday in San Francisco Apple introduced new iPhone models with faster processors and a new feature called D Touch which allows easy access to frequent tasks by holding down on an icon For instance it ll be possible to update a Facebook status right from the home screen Android still dominates overall with iPhones making up only about percent of smartphones sold around the world But Apple s phones tend to be more profitable Rivals like Samsung and HTC sell many lower cost phones that carry lower profit margins IDC recently lowered its overall forecast for smartphone shipments in saying once hot markets like China are becoming mature meaning many people already have phones Apple has seen strong growth in China however and CEO Tim Cook has touted the company s opportunities there a m p m Central Most smartphone users are accustomed to multi touch the ability for phones to recognize touches from multiple fingers enabling such capabilities as pinching to zoom Now comes D Touch Pressing down hard on the new iPhones will launch additional capabilities For example you can get quick access to tasks such as taking a selfie or getting directions home From a message D Touch will give you a preview of a Web link without launching the browser Apple announced the new feature at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday Apple introduced this concept with some Mac laptops in March It s called Force Touch on other devices Press for a few seconds on a document icon and a preview pops out Press on an address in an email and a map opens up On some video apps the pressure determines how quickly you forward or rewind Apple Watch also has Force Touch Press on the Workout app for instance to pause or end a run a m Central Apple says the frames of the new iPhones will be made of a stronger form of aluminum Last fall Apple got some complaints that the iPhone Plus was more prone to bending than previous models Apple defended its manufacturing standards and said bending was rare with normal use of an iPhone Still the stronger frame in this year s iPhone s and s Plus should help reduce those problems Apple is announcing the new models Wednesday The jumbo Samsung phones released last month the Galaxy Note and the Galaxy S Edge Plus also have stronger aluminum frames than before a m p m Central Apple s new Apple TV set top box will start at and will be available in late October The company will continue selling the existing model for a price that had dropped from in March The main Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices cost about though cheaper versions with fewer features are available as low as for the Amazon Fire TV Stick Google also sells a Chromecast device for Maynard Um of Wells Fargo Securities has said that to justify a higher price Apple will have to provide significant innovation and functionality The new Apple TV has new capabilities such as voice controls and non video apps including games and shopping Even video apps will have more capabilities including baseball stats and the ability to watch two games at once side by side It remains to be seen whether consumers will consider those capabilities to be enough The new device was announced Wednesday at an Apple event in San Francisco a m p m central Apple s set top box is catching up with such rivals as Roku and Amazon s Fire TV with the ability to install new apps on the device and to search for video with voice controls Apple has long insisted on controlling apps available on the device s home screen In doing so it can ensure that menus and keyboards look and feel the same whether you re on Netflix or PBS But there have been many services unavailable on the home screen To watch on the TV viewers have had to launch those apps on an iPhone or iPad first and use a feature called AirPlay to get video on the TV through the home Wi Fi network Complicated Having app choices directly on the home screen make things simpler To make sure everything runs smoothly Apple created a new version of its mobile operating system called tvOS The app store also allows for non video services such as games and music A new remote has a Siri microphone button for voice commands such as show me some comedies The new device can search through shows and movies available on a range of apps including Netflix Hulu HBO and Showtime a m p m central Apple says its new iPad will be available in November The larger screen iPad Pro model is aimed at countering weakening consumer demand for tablets The iPad was a runaway success when it was introduced in but sales have been declining since In part that s because competitors are now selling a number of lower priced tablets that use Google s Android software But sales of rivals tablets have been getting weaker too Analysts say some users are finding tablets aren t well suited for tasks that are easier to perform on a PC with a keyboard and mouse And many consumers don t see a need to upgrade their old tablets as often as they upgrade phones In response Apple has tried to cultivate more iPad customers in the business world It has partnered with IBM to develop new iPad software for workers in specific industries such as airlines and health care At an Apple event in San Francisco on Wednesday an executive from Apple s former rival Microsoft demonstrated the iPad Pro s productivity potential using Microsoft Office and other apps Other companies showed off using the iPad Pro for creativity tasks and health care including an app for doctors to show patients what s happening with D graphics The starting price is with gigabytes of storage By contrast the iPad Air starts at but the starting model has half the memory a m p m central Apple says it will make a larger screen iPad tablet aimed at business users The iPad Pro as it s called will take advantage of new multitasking features coming to existing iPads A software update will enable iPads to run two apps side by side something previously limited to Samsung and Windows tablets With a larger screen on the new iPad Pro apps running side by side will have more room to breathe The new iPad will have a inch screen compared with inches for the current full size iPad It will have four speakers and options for a physical keyboard and a stylus called Apple Pencil Despite the larger size Apple says it s about the same weight as the original iPad Samsung made a tablet aimed at professionals last year It had screens as large as inches and also came with a stylus More recently though Samsung has been shrinking the screens on its tablets The new iPad also marks Apple s latest attempt to steal corporate customers away from Microsoft whose personal computers have been business staple for decades Microsoft makes a tablet designed for the needs of office workers called the Surface Pro that sells at prices starting at With a inch display screen the Surface Pro is slightly smaller than Apple s new tablet Although there has been a lot of speculation that Apple would do make a larger iPad an announcement wasn t expected until October A release date and price wasn t immediately known Apple announced the new iPad in San Francisco on Wednesday a m p m central Apple says a software update for the Apple Watch is allowing outsider developers to write more sophisticated apps With the update outside developers can make apps specifically for the watch and interact directly with its sensors and controls That will enable apps that analyze golf swings or record audio Before third party apps have been limited to being extensions of apps that run on the iPhone The new software will be available as a free download starting next Wednesday At an event in San Francisco Wednesday Apple said there are now apps designed for the watch including ones from Facebook and GoPro the later using the watch s screen as a viewfinder for the video camera Apple says the new capabilities will also allow additional health related apps The upcoming Samsung Gear S will also allow outside parties to write apps that run directly on the watch Google is also hoping programmers create apps that can work independently on watches running on its Android Wear software a m a m central Apple investors are hoping that new iPhones and other products expected Wednesday will boost the company s stock Apple isn t saying what the event in downtown San Francisco is about but the company usually announces new iPhones around this time Apple s stock has fallen as investors fret over whether the company can duplicate the phenomenal sales growth it saw after introducing last year s iPhone and Plus In a note to clients FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives says the event is critical for Apple to help turn the negative investor tide and help lay out its growth vision for the next year Analyst Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets says the announcements should be a positive catalyst for Apple shares But Maynard Um of Wells Fargo Securities says many investors already have low expectations Um says this year s iPhones aren t expected to be dramatically different from last year s models a m PDT a m central New iPhones expected from Apple on Wednesday come amid questions about whether the company can sustain growth for its best selling device Apple sold more than million iPhones in the first three months after it released the super sized iPhone and Plus models last year That s percent more phones than it sold in the same period a year earlier To get that same percent increase Apple would have to sell more than million iPhones in the next three months Jerry Kim a Columbia University management professor says the expectations might seem unfair but Wall Street will definitely be disappointed if they can t break another record next quarter Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he believes there is still room for iPhone sales to expand He s told analysts that an increasing number of iPhone buyers are people who used to own devices running Google s Android software Research firm Kantar Worldpanel says

Huawei set for brand boost from Google October at am By AFP Comment on this story REUTERS The headquarters of Huawei Technologies in Shenzhen in China s Guangdong province Beijing With a partnership to make one of Google s flagship Nexus smartphones Chinese tech giant Huawei is gaining new prominence which could help its efforts to win broader global consumer appeal Huawei was tapped this week to produce the Nexus P one of two handsets unveiled this week by Google to showcase its Android mobile operating system The large screen phablet was unveiled as a rival to the iPhone S Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note A second Google phone the Nexus X will be made by South Korea s LG At a time when Chinese firms are struggling to break the dominance of Apple and Samsung on the high end of the smartphone market the partnership is a milestone for Huawei Clearly working with Google is vote of confidence in the technology of the product said Ian Fogg senior director at the consultancy IHS Technology Fogg said the Nexus devices are intended to be showcases of the best of Android technology and are designed to be seen as innovation leaders that s an incredibly valuable association to have The new Nexus P phone was introduced by Google at a press event in San Francisco California The Nexus X and Nexus P phones run on Android Marshmallow Picture Google via EPA EPA The deal with Google opens up a route into the US market to raise visibility for Huawei smartphones Fogg noted Huawei will be particularly pleased if this can be a bridgehead into the US market Fogg said that this also helps Google which is largely absent from China should the US company decide to dive back into the large market In its home market of China Huawei has both mobile operator relationships as well as its own expertise in selling smartphones direct to consumers Fogg said Huawei has been selling some unlocked high end devices direct to US and European consumers and has a share of the prepaid low end smartphone market along with Chinese rival ZTE But Huawei and other Chinese makers have generally lacked the appeal of Apple and Samsung for high end smartphone customers The association with Google provides a brand boost for Huawei noted Avi Greengart who follows mobile technology at the research firm Current Analysis If you are buying a Nexus phone and it has a Chinese brand prominently displayed that s definitely a positive Greengart noted that consumers will be looking at more options now that many US carriers and unbundling the service from the device The Nexus P which starts at for US customers is being sold for less than the rival Apple S Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note which cost at least Once you break the direct connection between the service and the hardware it becomes easier for consumers to buy their device separately and it makes a Nexus more attractive Greengart said The partnership could boost the prominence of Huawei which has received media attention from US government allegations that the company is a security threat because of perceived close links to the Chinese government The company denies the allegations Last year news reports said the US National Security Agency had been secretly tapping the company s networks for years Huawei is one of the largest providers of network infrastructure globally but its consumer products are less well known outside China Some analysts say it remains questionable whether Huawei can parlay the Google deal into a stronger position in the smartphone market I think people gravitate toward Nexus because it is a Google device said Ramon Llamas who follows mobile technology for research firm IDC Llamas said other manufacturers partnering with Google on Nexus HTC LG and Motorola for example have failed to get a major boost for their brands from the deals Huawei could see some boost in sales but not enough to catapult them to a challenge of Samsung or Apple he told AFP While Chinese makers have gained ground recently lifted in part by Lenovo s acquisition of the Motorola brand none of them are breaking away from the pack Llamas said Apple and Samsung really control the high end But IHS s Fogg said the mobile market can shift quickly pointing out that previous market leaders like Nokia and BlackBerry have seen their leadership fade quickly Nothing is forever in the smartphone market Fogg said AFP
YORKTOWN HEIGHTS N Y and ANN ARBOR Mich Oct PRNewswire IBM Research NYSE IBM today announced that it is providing advanced solar forecasting technology to help the University of Michigan UM team power its solar car in the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge an mile kilometer race across the Australian Outback The UM student team will leverage IBM Research s cognitive computing expertise to gain real time insights into conditions such as cloud cover and wind patterns as well as determine how much solar power will be available to fuel their car along the course race As the car is solely powered by solar energy more accurate forecasts can help the UM students decide how to drive their car more efficiently and improve their chances for winning IBM researchers are using machine learning to blend data from sensor networks and local weather stations cloud motion physics derived from sky cameras and satellite observations and multiple weather prediction models In contrast most current forecasting techniques rely on individual weather models that offer a less comprehensive view of the variables that affect the availability of renewable energy such as solar IBM developed the technology through a program supported by the U S Department of Energy s SunShot Initiative to find new ways to improve the accuracy of solar forecasts that can then be used to optimize solar resources as they re increasingly integrated into the nation s energy grid By using state of art machine learning and other cognitive computing technologies IBM scientists can generate solar and wind forecasts that are up to percent more accurate than ones created using conventional approaches whether minutes or days in advance Our goal is to design engineer and race the best solar powered vehicle in the world said Leda Daehler chief strategist on the UM Solar Car Team Predicting solar radiation plays a huge part in designing a strategy for solar car racing IBM s forecasting technology will help our team adapt and optimize our approach in real time and we expect it to provide a true advantage over the course of the race Chasing the Sun The UM Solar Car Team is one of the world s most successful solar car race teams holding numerous international and national championships This year the team is confident that IBM s solar forecasting technology will help them make better decisions in their racing strategy when their car Aurum competes over four days in the World Solar Challenge The team will leverage two kinds of forecasts provided by IBM s solar forecasting technology One technique enables the students to obtain more accurate forecasts on the race route two or three days ahead The technology continuously monitors weather conditions and analyzes the data to forecast how much solar energy will be available at different locations and times It incorporates a large number of weather and solar prediction models which it blends through machine learning to produce a supermodel The system learns from a large amount of historical data as well as data gathered along the race course The second forecasting technique applies to near real time conditions In the World Solar Challenge the UM Solar Car Team will have a sky camera mounted on the hood of two scout cars that run a few minutes to one hour ahead of their car Aurum The system developed by IBM plots the location and the transparency of clouds so the team can decide the speed the car should go to get maximum solar energy Simulations have shown that this technique could gain the team up to minutes per day The University of Michigan has been competing in solar car races for years In the past we have not been able to capture and analyze the variety and amount of cloud data needed to confidently impact our race strategy said Pavan Naik program manager for the UM Solar Car Team This year IBM s solar forecasting technology will allow us to know where the clouds are where they are going and where we should go faster in order to chase the sun The collaboration with the UM Solar Car Team provides IBM scientists a unique environment to continue to develop their solar forecasting technology and to learn new techniques that can help improve forecasting accuracy These advances are important to the future of alternative energy and every industry that is susceptible to the impact of weather on operations and how they conduct their business We are excited to explore how cognitive computing can augment the capabilities of this extraordinary group of students at the University of Michigan to compete in the World Solar Challenge said Dario Gil vice president of Science and Technology IBM Research We are using physical analytics to combine our understanding of the physical world with two of the most exciting fields in computer science data analytics and machine learning which will lead to new innovations that can transform industries To learn more on how IBM helped the UM Solar Car

When you visit a website you often find yourself waiting and waiting for advertisements to load Video starts playing automatically and animated ads jump in front of what you were there to see The seconds tick by It doesn t have to be this way There are easy ways to block such annoyances and Apple is now permitting apps that block ads in its Web browser for iPhones and iPads All this might help users navigate but it also threatens the livelihood of websites and publishers that depend heavily on advertising revenue companies like Google Hulu and The New York Times While the rise in ad blocking isn t causing panic yet publishers and content creators are watching Already some websites are taking steps to reduce the annoyance so users won t turn to ad blockers They are also subverting the ones out there to make sure they get paid for delivering news and entertainment It is possible to be too alarmist about ad blockers but it s a very real phenomenon said Joshua Benton director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University It s one thing if just percent of iPhone users install an ad blocker it s another if percent do Benton said If today s ad practices get too annoying he said they could disappear just like pop up windows which many browsers now block automatically in response to consumers annoyance with them Facebook now selling video ads targeted users will see Tribune wire reports Facebook is now selling video ads that the target audience is sure to see The world s biggest online social network said Thursday that advertisers can now buy ads that will be seen from top to bottom on a user s screen Of course this is still no guarantee that the user will choose to watch Facebook is now selling video ads that the target audience is sure to see The world s biggest online social network said Thursday that advertisers can now buy ads that will be seen from top to bottom on a user s screen Of course this is still no guarantee that the user will choose to watch Tribune wire reports Over the years websites have been more aggressive at delivering ads that break through the noise and target specific customers more precisely But websites are also filling unsold ad space by turning to ad brokers to deliver pitches that are less and less relevant Every little bit can slow down or freeze your browser I think publishers got very out of hand in terms of what they put on said Dean Murphy a Yarm England app developer who responded by creating Crystal a ad blocker for Apple devices Craig Smith a year old website developer in Musselburgh Scotland said Twitter started showing him ads for adjustable waistband trousers not long after he and his followers discussed about how ridiculous his grandfather s trousers looked in a photo All of a sudden you re getting hammered with stuff you ve got no interest in he said It just makes the whole browsing experience really unpleasant PageFair a firm that seeks to counter ad blockers says worldwide usage of ad blockers grew percent from last year to nearly million people That s percent of Internet users worldwide including percent in the U S percent in Greece and percent in Germany PageFair estimates these tools will block nearly billion in ad revenue this year and billion next year The threats to websites are about to get bigger The ability to block ads long available on traditional computers arrived on Apple s mobile devices with a recent software update iOS Apps with these capabilities going by such names as Purify Blocker and Blockr quickly became top sellers These tools affect only the Safari browser and won t block ads inside apps such as Twitter Facebook and Apple s own News app Google s Android system also allows ad blockers in Web browsers such as Firefox as long as they don t affect unrelated apps Many websites already have countermeasures for ad blockers Hulu for instance simply replaces commercials with an unskippable message prompting you to turn your ad blocker off Or you can pay Hulu a month to go ad free Meanwhile some companies are paying developers of ad blockers such as Adblock Plus for the right to bypass them Companies that benefit a lot from search ads like Google and Microsoft pay for the privilege the Financial Times reported Microsoft declined to confirm the report Google didn t respond to requests for comment although the list of Web addresses that get a pass includes many from Google Hulu declined comment All this raises questions about the role of ad blocking companies Ad blockers streamline the user experience without contributing back to the digital economy even as they seek to make money by charging websites for the right to nullify their impact Smaller websites can get a free pass from ad blockers but only if they forego revenue from video ads or other display ads deemed intrusive Perhaps there s another way a truce of sorts Some companies are trying to create a smoother experience to get at the root cause of consumer frustration Apple s News app Facebook s Instant Articles and SnapChat s Discover all seek to speed up online journalism and cut back advertising while sharing revenue with news outlets The New York Times has ads in Apple News but it s looking for ways to make them less obtrusive For instance the Times says it s selling ads by time of day and encouraging marketers to tailor their messages accordingly like making ads that help readers prepare for the day in the morning but entertain them at night The Washington Post has been testing whether visitors with ad blockers installed would respond to being redirected to a page that asks them to pay for a subscription And on Tuesday the Post said all of its articles will be available through Facebook s new service for lightning fast reading sharing and commenting from Apple devices The market wouldn t be robust for ad blockers if some ads weren t intrusive creepy hold you hostage or slow down your experience said Jed Hartman the Post s chief revenue officer Everything should be on the table fewer ads different types of ads no ads Meanwhile the industry group Interactive Advertising Bureau is pushing for viewable ads that load only when that part of the page is visible That way marketers don t pay for ads that aren t seen and sites should load faster Randall Rothenberg the group s CEO called ad blocking practices definitely immoral and unethical yet he acknowledged that consumers turn to blockers because they are fed up Consumers are speaking and you ve got to listen to them he said Associated Press Apple Inc Hulu
Advancements in All flash Performance and Price Make the ROI of Moving to All flash Arrays More than Just Compelling for Enterprise Storage Austin Texas The flash versus Hard Disk Drive HDD trade off has been discussed for several years now in all corners of the enterprise storage marketplace While companies offering flash solutions claimed better performance and higher IOPS the balancing act was between price performance with capacity and data storage requirements Until now that trade off may have kept all flash storage arrays from moving from critical workloads in the datacenter to all active workloads However with flash capacity up to four times what it was in years past and density up per cent and entry prices down per cent making the entry list price point less than half what it was in there has never been a better time to evaluate all flash arrays to provide dramatic application acceleration and proven reliability The fresh data that DCIG has compiled for the latest All Flash Array Buyer s Guide shows that all flash array vendors have substantially reduced the barriers to all flash adoption said Chuck Cook research analyst and co author of the DCIG All Flash Array Buyer s Guide While GB may be one of the least favorable ways or evaluating flash memory costs many vendors in our Guide now claim a cost per GB after deduplication and compression of less than This is just one of the many reasons why there is growing interest in deploying all flash systems With the introduction of our newest All Flash Array Buyer s Guide I am confident this will give customers an easy to use and powerful tool to shortlist solutions they will want to bring in house to test For the DCIG All Flash Array Buyer s Guide DCIG LLC evaluated offerings from companies After an initial survey containing more than questions was completed product capabilities were assessed based on data provided by the vendor prior DCIG research and information available in the public domain Products were then evaluated on more than features After scores were compiled products were ranked Best in Class Recommended Excellent Good or Basic across functionality and capability relative to the other products included in the Buyer s Guide The intent for this Buyer s Guide as with all DCIG Buyer s Guides is to provide an at a glance comparison that enables organizations to quickly get to a short list of products that may meet their requirements The DCIG All Flash Array Buyer s Guide Top solutions include in alphabetical order AMI StorTrends i Series Dell Compellent SC Hitachi Data Systems HUS VM HP PAR StoreServ Series HP PAR StoreServ c Series IBM FlashSystem V NetApp AFF Series Pure Storage FlashArray m Series SolidFire SF Series and Tegile IntelliFlash T Series HP PAR StoreServ Series achieved Best in Class ranking in this Guide for the best balance of strengths across all the scoring categories HP PAR StoreServ Series stood out in several ways from competitive solutions listed in the Buyer s Guide They include Multi protocol support Support for SAN NAS and object access with additional support for data migration to OpenStack clouds Advanced VMware and Microsoft virtualization support Support for VMware VVols and Microsoft SCVMM ODX and SMB High Scalability and Availability Scales to eight controllers GB cache and four Petabytes of raw all flash capacity It also packs Terabytes per rack unit TB U making it one of the highest density arrays in the Guide Designed for Enterprise Consolidation Claims M IOPS with sub millisecond latencies With the HP PAR Gen Thin Express ASICs tuned to specifically manage flash and optimize performance Extensive Automated Policy based Provisioning Capabilities Storage templates can include SLA QoS requirements or use policies to automatically select the appropriate storage location Broad QoS options Guaranteed minimum or maximum IOPS bandwidth and system response time for each volume APIs are available for use by third party automation tools and a Software Defined Kit SDK is available for integrating with management software The DCIG All Flash Array Buyer s Guide achieves the following objectives Provides an objective third party evaluation of All Flash Arrays that evaluates and scores their features from an end user s perspective Scores and ranks features of each All Flash Array on criteria that matter most to end users Provides a standardized data sheet for each of the All Flash Arrays so users may do quick side by side comparisons of products Gives any organization a solid foundation for getting competitive bids from different providers that are based on apples to apples comparisons The barriers to all flash adoption have been substantially reduced added Ken Clipperton managing analyst and co author of the All Flash Array Buyer s Guide When we introduced our first Guide for flash arrays in there was still a discussion over terminology and effective use cases for all flash systems And it wasn t just about terminology in The first arrays had limited capacity and data services as a result all flash systems were deployed to tackle specific storage related pain points Fast forward to today and you find all flash solutions with comprehensive set of features expected of an enterprise storage array The winners of course are the purchasers of all flash arrays and for that reason we know this Guide will help them accelerate the product research and selection process and in turn save them time and money in the process Disclosure and Methodology DCIG identified companies that provide All Flash Arrays Each All Flash Array had to meet the following criteria Available as a rack mountable appliance Must be marketed as an All Flash Array The best evidence of meeting this criterion is the existence of a specific all flash SKU Must use flash memory as primary storage not merely as an extended cache Must be formally announced and or generally available for purchase as of June It is important to note that no vendors whether clients or not for this Buyer s Guide or all Buyer s Guides before were afforded preferential treatment All research was based upon information provided directly by vendors research and analysis by DCIG and other publicly available information and all results solely reflect the opinion of DCIG As with all Buyer s Guide they are not intended to be a substitute for internal testing nor was any product testing completed DCIG encourages any organization that is considering the purchase of any solution included in a Buyer s Guide to do its

Judge dismisses Wikimedia lawsuit over NSA surveillance report WASHINGTON WASHINGTON Oct A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by Wikimedia and other groups challenging one of the U S National Security Agency s mass surveillance programs the Baltimore Sun reported The newspaper said Judge T S Ellis III on Friday dismissed the suit filed in March over what is often called upstream collection because it happens along the so called backbone of the Internet and away from individual users The lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland where the spy agency is based said the NSA is violating U S constitutional protections and the law by tapping into high capacity cables switches and routers that move Internet traffic through the United States The case is one of a number of challenges made by privacy advocates against U S spying programs since when documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the long reach of secret government surveillance The judge concluded that the plaintiffs had to speculate about key elements of the spy system So under a Supreme Court ruling on a similar challenge he wrote their case could not go forward the Sun said Plaintiffs provide no factual basis to support the allegation that the NSA is using its surveillance equipment at full throttle Ellis wrote according to the newspaper The plaintiffs include the Wikimedia Foundation which runs the online encyclopedia Wikipedia the conservative Rutherford Institute Amnesty International USA and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers among other groups The groups said in the lawsuit that upstream surveillance reduces the likelihood that clients journalists foreign government officials victims of human rights abuses and other individuals will share sensitive information with them The American Civil Liberties Union which represented the plaintiffs said it is considering an appeal the paper said The decision turns a blind eye to the fact that the government is tapping into the Internet s backbone to spy on millions of Americans it quoted ACLU lawyer Patrick Toomey as saying in a statement The dismissal of the lawsuit s claims as speculative is at odds with an overwhelming public record of warrantless surveillance Reporting by Mohammad Zargham Editing by Marguerita Choy Trending On Reuters
